Since January 2020, when the virus was identified in humans, the literature on COVID-19 has grown exponentially, and extra respiratory symptoms including neurological symptoms are increasingly highlighted. These neurological disorders are grouped into several categories, ranging from non-specific and moderate symptoms such as headache, myalgia and hyposmia to severe symptoms including cerebrovascular disease and intracranial infections. Severe neurological symptoms such as acute cerebrovascular disease occur only in a minority of patients with usual risk factor, and are associated with poor outcome. However, most COVID-19 patients exhibit only minor or mild neurological symptoms. Given the high and increasing number of publications reporting neurological involvements of SARS-Cov-2, we think providing an update for neurological complications of COVID-19 could be useful for physician and especially young trainees in neurology and neurosurgery. Indeed, in this review we discuss several neurological aspects reported in the literature to date, including the evidence and pathways of the neuro-invasion in COVID-19, and the main neurological disorders reported in the literature to date, as well as the future perspectives and the potential long term consequence of current neuro-infection in COVID-19 patients.","World Neurosurg","Abboud, Hilal","Abboud, Fatima Zahra","Kharbouch, Hanane","Arkha, Yasser","Abbadi, Najia El","Ouahabi, Abdessamad El","32474093"],"abstract":["Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-Cov-2, resulting in severe acute respiratory syndrome, with high potential of spreading and infecting humans worldwide.

Neurological manifestations were extracted from the identified manuscripts and combined to provide a useful summary for the neurologist in clinical practice. RESULTS: Neurological manifestations potentially related to COVID-19 have been reported in large studies, case series and case reports and include acute cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness, cranial nerve manifestations and auto-immune disorders such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome often present in patients with more severe COVID-19. Cranial nerve symptoms such as olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are highly prevalent in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 even without associated nasal symptoms and often present in an early stage of the disease. CONCLUSION: Physicians should be aware of the neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19, especially when rapid clinical deterioration occurs. The neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients may be due to direct viral neurological injury or indirect neuroinflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms.
