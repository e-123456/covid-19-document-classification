BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has infected thousands of people and placed enormous stress on healthcare system.

METHODS: This was a single center cross-sectional observational study. From November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, we compared outcome of patients admitted for acute ST-elevation MI (STEMI) and non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) before (group 1) and after (group 2) January 25, 2020 which was the date when Hong Kong hospitals launched emergency response measures to combat COVID-19. RESULTS: There was a reduction in daily emergency room attendance since January 25, 2020 (group 1,327/day vs. group 2,231/day) and 149 patients with diagnosis of MI were included into analysis (group 1 N = 85 vs. group 2 N = 64).
