Elective interventions and surgical procedures in most countries have been postponed and operating room resources have been diverted to manage the pandemic. The Venous and Lymphatic Triage and Acuity Scale (VELTAS) was developed to provide an international standard to rationalise and harmonise the management of patients with venous and lymphatic disorders or vascular anomalies. Triage urgency was determined based on clinical assessment of urgency with which a patient would require medical treatment or surgical intervention. Clinical conditions were classified into six categories of: 1) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), 2) Chronic Venous Disease (CVD), 3) Vascular anomalies, 4) Venous trauma 5) Venous compression and 6) Lymphatic disease. Triage urgency was categorised into four groups and individual conditions were allocated to each class of triage. These included 1) Medical Emergencies (requiring immediate attendance), example massive pulmonary embolism; 2) Urgent (to be seen as soon as possible), example deep vein thrombosis ; 3) Semi-urgent (to be attended to within 30-90 days), example highly symptomatic CVD, and 4) Discretionary/Non-urgent- (to be seen within 6-12 months), example chronic lymphoedema. VELTAS aims to standardise the triage of patients with venous and lymphatic disease or vascular anomalies by providing an international consensus-based classification of clinical categories and triage urgency.
