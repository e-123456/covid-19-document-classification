Autopsies were done with consent of the decedents' next of kin.

METHODS: This study reports autopsy findings of 21 COVID-19 patients hospitalised at the University Hospital Basel and at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Switzerland.

RESULTS: The primary cause of death was respiratory failure with exudative diffuse alveolar damage with massive capillary congestion often accompanied by microthrombi despite anticoagulation. Ten cases showed superimposed bronchopneumonia. Further findings included pulmonary embolisms (n=4), alveolar haemorrhage (n=3) and vasculitis (n=1).
