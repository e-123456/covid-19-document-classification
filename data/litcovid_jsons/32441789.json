The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (21.1%, 95% CI: 13.0-27.2%) and diabetes (9.7%, 95% CI: 7.2-12.2%), followed by cardiovascular disease (8.4%, 95% CI: 3.8-13.8%) and respiratory system disease (1.5%, 95% CI: 0.9-2.1%). When compared between severe and non-severe patients, the pooled OR of hypertension, respiratory system disease, and cardiovascular disease were 2.36 (95% CI: 1.46-3.83), 2.46 (95% CI: 1.76-3.44) and 3.42 (95% CI: 1.88-6.22) respectively. CONCLUSION: We assessed the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 patients and found that underlying disease, including hypertension, respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease, may be risk factors for severe patients compared with non-severe patients."],"journal":"Int J Infect Dis","authors":["Yang, Jing","Zheng, Ya","Gou, Xi","Pu, Ke","Chen, Zhaofeng","Guo, Qinghong","Ji, Rui","Wang, Haojia","Wang, Yuping","Zhou, Yongning"],"date":"2020-03-17T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32173574","source":"PubMed","week":"202012|Mar 16 - Mar 22","doi":"10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.017","keywords":["covid-19","clinical characteristics","comorbidities","epidemiology","meta-analysis","sars-cov-2"],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"weight":0,"_version_":1666138492594290689,"score":253.74608},{"pmid":32425234,"pmcid":"PMC7233252","title":"Corticosteroids, but not TNF Antagonists, are Associated with Adverse COVID-19 Outcomes in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Results from an International Registry.","text":["Corticosteroids, but not TNF Antagonists, are Associated with Adverse COVID-19 Outcomes in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Results from an International Registry.","Background and Aims: The impact of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unknown. We sought to characterize the clinical course of COVID-19 among IBD patients and evaluate the association between demographics, clinical characteristics, and immunosuppressant treatments on COVID-19 outcomes. Methods: Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SECURE-IBD) is a large, international registry created to monitor outcomes of IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19. We calculated age-standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and utilized multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, and/or death. Results: 525 cases from 33 countries were reported (Median age 43 years, 53% men). Thirty-seven patients (7%) had severe COVID-19, 161 (31%) were hospitalized, and 16 patients died (3% case fatality rate). SMRs for IBD patients were 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-2.6), 1.5 (95% CI 0.7-2.2), and 1.7 (95% CI 0.9-2.5) relative to data from China, Italy, and the US, respectively. Risk factors for severe COVID-19 among IBD patients included increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.02), >/=2 comorbidities (aOR 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.8), systemic corticosteroids (aOR 6.9, 95% CI 2.3-20.5), and sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylate use (aOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3-7.7). TNF antagonist treatment was not associated with severe COVID-19 (aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.4-2.2). Conclusions: Increasing age, comorbidities, and corticosteroids are associated with severe COVID-19 among IBD patients, although a causal relationship cannot be definitively established.
