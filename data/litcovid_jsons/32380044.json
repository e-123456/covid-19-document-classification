This study analyzed obesity as an independent risk factor for mortality in hospitalized patients younger than fifty. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of COVID-19 patients hospitalized to a large academic hospital system in New York City between March 1st and May 17th, 2020. Data included demographics, comorbidities, BMI and smoking status. Obesity groups included: BMI 30-40 kg/m(2) and BMI >/= 40 kg/m(2) . Multivariable logistic regression models identified variables independently associated with mortality in patients younger and older than 50. RESULTS: Overall, 3,406 patients were included. 572 (17.0%) of the patients were younger than 50. In the younger age group, 60 (10.5%) patients died. In the older age group, 1,076 (38.0%) patients died. For the younger population, BMI above 40 kg/m(2) was independently associated with mortality (aOR 5.1, 95% CI 2.3-11.1). For the older population, BMI above 40 kg/m2 was also independently associated with mortality to a lesser extent (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 - 2.3). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that hospitalized patients younger than 50 with morbid obesity are more likely to die from COVID-19. This is particularly relevant in the western world where obesity rates are high.","Obesity (Silver Spring)","Klang, Eyal","Kassim, Gassan","Soffer, Shelly","Freeman, Robert","Levin, Matthew A","Reich, David L","32445512"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 continues to spread and younger patients are also being critically affected.
