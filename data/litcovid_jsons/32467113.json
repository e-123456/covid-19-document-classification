METHODS: To examine presentation and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with ESKD on dialysis, we retrospectively collected clinical data on 59 patients on dialysis who were hospitalized with COVID-19. We used Wilcoxon rank sum and Fischer exact tests to compare patients who died versus those still living. RESULTS: Two of the study's 59 patients were on peritoneal dialysis, and 57 were on hemodialysis. Median age was 63 years, with high prevalence of hypertension (98%) and diabetes (69%). Patients who died were significantly older than those still living (median age, 75 versus 62 years) and had a higher median Charlson comorbidity index (8 versus 7). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (49%) and cough (39%); initial radiographs most commonly showed multifocal or bilateral opacities (59%). By end of follow-up, 18 patients (31%) died a median 6 days after hospitalization, including 75% of patients who required mechanical ventilation. Eleven of those who died had advanced directives against intubation. The remaining 41 patients (69%) were discharged home a median 8 days after admission. The median initial white blood cell count was significantly higher in patients who died compared with those still living (7.5 versus 5.7x10(3)/mul), as was C-reactive protein (163 versus 80 mg/L).
