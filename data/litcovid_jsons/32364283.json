METHODS: This was a retrospective multi-centre study, which included patients who sustained fractures between 20 January and 19 February 2020. The collected data included patients' demographics (age and gender), injury-related (injury type, fracture location, injury mechanism, places where fracture occurred), and treatment modality. SPSS 23.0 was used to describe the data and perform some analysis. RESULTS: A total of 436 patients with 453 fractures were included; there were 153 males and 283 females, with an average age of 76.2 years (standard deviation, SD, 7.7 years; 65 to 105). For either males or females, 70-74 years was the most commonly involved age group. A total of 317 (72.7%) patients had their fractures occurring at home. Among 453 fractures, there were 264 (58.3%) hip fractures, accounting for 58.3%. Fall from standing height was the most common cause of fracture, making a proportion of 89.4% (405/453).

Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) was the most used surgical method, taking a proportion of 49.2% (223/453).
