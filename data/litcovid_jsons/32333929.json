Healthcare systems around the world are trying to simultaneously treat patients with COVID-19 infection, prepare for its long-term impacts, and manage patients with other acute and chronic diseases. There are multiple ways that the COVID-19 pandemic will directly affect patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD), particularly given their common risk factors for poor outcomes. Major issues for patients with ILD will include restricted access to key components of the diagnostic process, new uncertainties in the use of common ILD pharmacotherapies, limited ability to monitor both disease severity and the presence of medication adverse effects, and significantly curtailed research activities. The purpose of this review is to summarize how COVID-19 has impacted key components of the diagnosis and management of fibrotic ILD as well as to provide strategies to mitigate these challenges. We further review major obstacles for researchers and identify priority areas for future ILD research related to COVID-19. Our goals are to provide practical considerations to support the care of patients with ILD during the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide a road map for clinicians caring for these patients during future infectious disease outbreaks.","Chest","Wong, Alyson W","Fidler, Lee","Marcoux, Veronica","Johannson, Kerri A","Assayag, Deborah","Fisher, Jolene H","Hambly, Nathan","Kolb, Martin","Morisset, Julie","Shapera, Shane","Ryerson, Christopher J","32333929"],"abstract":["The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has affected virtually all aspects of patient care.

Given the current growing spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) around the world, it is imperative that businesses review their pandemic plans and be prepared in case this epidemic expands and affects more people and communities. Preparing for a potential infectious disease pandemic from influenza or a novel corona virus is an essential component of a business continuity plan, especially for businesses that provide critical healthcare and infrastructure services. Although many businesses and organisations have a pandemic plan or address pandemic preparedness in their business continuity plans, few have recently tested and updated their plans. Pandemics can not only interrupt an organisation's operations and compromise long-term viability of an enterprise, but also disrupt the provision of critical functions. Businesses that regularly test and update their pandemic plan can significantly reduce harmful impacts to the business, play a key role in protecting employees' and customers' health and safety, and limit the negative impact of a pandemic on the community and economy.","J Bus Contin Emer Plan","Koonin, Lisa M","32160942"],"abstract":["This article outlines practical steps that businesses can take now to prepare for a pandemic.

Mechanisms to increase bed capacity as well as increase efficiency in intensive care units by outsourcing procedures were implemented. Novel uses of technology to minimize staff exposure to COVID-19, as well as to facilitate family engagement and end of life discussions were encouraged.
