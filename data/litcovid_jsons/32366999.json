This article provides guidance for ophthalmologists on how to deliver the best possible care for patients while minimizing the risk of infection. METHODS: The Vision Academy's Steering Committee of international retinal disease experts convened to discuss key considerations for managing patients with retinal disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. After reviewing the existing literature on the issue, members put forward recommendations that were systematically refined and voted on to develop this guidance. RESULTS: The considerations focus on the implementation of steps to minimize the exposure of patients and healthcare staff to COVID-19. These include the use of personal protective equipment, adherence to scrupulous hygiene and disinfection protocols, pre-screening to identify symptomatic patients, and reducing the number of people in waiting rooms. Other important measures include triaging of patients to identify those at the greatest risk of irreversible vision loss and prioritization of treatment visits over monitoring visits where possible. In order to limit patient exposure, ophthalmologists should refrain from using treatment regimens that require frequent monitoring. CONCLUSION: Management of patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 pandemic will require adjustment to regular clinical practice to minimize the risk of exposure of patients and healthcare staff, and to prioritize those with the greatest medical need. The safety of patients and healthcare staff should be of paramount importance in all decision-making.","Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol","Korobelnik, Jean-Francois","Loewenstein, Anat","Eldem, Bora","Joussen, Antonia M","Koh, Adrian","Lambrou, George N","Lanzetta, Paolo","Li, Xiaoxin","Lovestam-Adrian, Monica","Navarro, Rafael","Okada, Annabelle A","Pearce, Ian","Rodriguez, Francisco J","Wong, David T","Wu, Lihteh","32328757"],"abstract":["PURPOSE: There is an urgent need to address how to best provide ophthalmic care for patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents during the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: We present our experience of virtual, within-clinic remote visual acuity assessment to reduce the risk of infection with COVID-19. RESULTS: Along with standard recommendations for personal protective equipment and hand hygiene to contain viral spread and treating only urgent cases, remote within-clinic visual acuity testing and consultations can be undertaken with minimal specialist equipment and appears to provide useful information whilst being acceptable to patients. CONCLUSION: Ophthalmology practice must adapt in order to combat COVID-19.

In aesthetic clinics, most procedures are provided on one to one basis by the physician or therapist. In such a scenario, guidelines detailing the infection control measures for aesthetic clinics are of particular importance. METHODS: An online meeting of an international group of experts in the field of aesthetic medicine, with experience in administration of an aesthetic clinic, was convened. The meeting aimed to provide a set of consensus guidelines to protect clinic staff and patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Consensus guidelines for 'preferred practices' were provided for scheduling of patients, patient evaluation and triaging, and for safety precautions about the different procedures. Procedures were categorized into low-risk, moderate risk, and high-risk based on the likelihood of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus from the patient to the treating physician or therapist. CONCLUSIONS: While not intended to be complete or exhaustive, these guidelines provide sound infection control measures for aesthetic practices. Since guidelines regarding safety measures and use of PPEs may vary from country to country, the local guidelines should also be followed to prevent COVID-19 infection in aesthetic clinics.
