In this paper we highlight the potentially disastrous consequences of naive shared ventilation, in which patients are simply connected in parallel to a ventilator without any regard to their individual ventilatory requirements. We then examine possible approaches for individualization of mechanical ventilation, using modifications to the breathing circuit that may enable tuning of individual tidal volumes and driving pressures during either volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) or pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV). METHODS: Breathing circuit modifications included a PEEP valve on each expiratory limb for both VCV and PCV, an adjustable constriction and one-way valve on the inspiratory limb for VCV, and a pressure relief valve for peak-inspiratory pressure reduction on the inspiratory limb for PCV. The ability to regulate individual tidal volumes using these breathing circuit modifications was tested both theoretically in computer simulations as well as experimentally in mechanical test lungs. RESULTS: In both the simulations and experimental measurements, naive shared ventilation resulted in large imbalances across individual tidal volume delivery, dependent on imbalances across patient mechanical properties. The proposed breathing circuit modifications for shared VCV and shared PCV enabled optimization of tidal volume distributions. Individual tidal volume for one patient during shared VCV was sensitive to changes in the mechanical properties of other patients. By contrast, shared PCV enabled independent control of individual patient received ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Of the shared ventilation strategies considered, shared PCV, with the inclusion of in-line pressure relief valves in the individual inspiratory and expiratory limbs, offers the greatest degree of safety and lowest risk of catastrophic mechanical interactions between multiple patients connected to a single ventilator.","Respir Care","Herrmann, Jacob","Fonseca da Cruz, Andrea","Hawley, Monica L","Branson, Richard D","Kaczka, David W","32376612"],"abstract":["INTRODUCTION: The use of shared ventilation, or the simultaneous support of multiple patients connected in parallel to a single mechanical ventilator, is receiving considerable interest for addressing the severe shortage of mechanical ventilators available during the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).

Despite a plethora of information on the Internet, there is little supporting evidence and no human studies. The risk of multiplex ventilation is that ventilation and PEEP effects are largely uncontrollable and depend on the difference between patient resistance, (R) and compliance (C). It is not clear whether volume control or pressure control is safer or more effective. We designed a simulation-based study to allow complete control over the relevant variables to determine the effects of various degrees of RC imbalance on tidal volume (VT), end-expiratory lung volume (VEE), and imputed pH. METHODS: Two separate breathing simulators were ventilated with a ventilator using pressure control (PC) and volume control (VC) breaths. Evidence-based lung models simulated a range of differences in R and C (six pairs of simulated patients). Differences in VT, VEE, and imputed pH were recorded. RESULTS: Depending on differences in R and C, differences in VT ranged from 1% (equal R and C) to 79%. Differences in VEE ranged from 2% to 109%. Differences in pH ranged from 0% to 5%. Failure due to excessive tidal volume (> 8 mL/kg) did not occur. Failure due to excessive VEE difference (> 10%) was evident in 50% of patient pairs. There was no difference in failure rate between VC and PC. CONCLUSIONS: These experiments confirmed the potential for markedly different ventilation and oxygenation for patients with uneven respiratory system impedances during multiplex ventilation. Three critical problems must be solved to minimize risk: (1) partitioning of inspiratory flow from the ventilator individually between the two patients, (2) measurement of VT delivered to each patient, and (3) provision for individual PEEP.
