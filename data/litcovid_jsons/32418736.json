Data sources: We reviewed available databases and searched systematically for publications. To be taken into account, data had to be broken down by gender. There was no study evaluation nor quantification synthesis, due to the large heterogeneity of the studies. Nineteen databases were selected. 73 publications were considered and 33 were selected, to which 12 more were added. Results: Globally, the proportion of men and women who tested positive is comparable. However, men are about 60% more likely to be severely ill or to die from the complications of Covid-19 than are women. Limitations: The study was hampered by a large heterogeneity in testing and reporting of the data. Conclusions: Although in the pandemic men die more frequently than women from Covid-19, it is not clear whether this is due to biological differences between men and women, differences in behavioral habits, or differences in the rates of co-morbidities. Implications of key findings: Countries and studies should report their data by age, gender and co-morbidities. This may have implications in terms of vaccination strategies, the choice of treatments and future consequences for long-term health issues concerning gender equality.","Maturitas","Serge, Rozenberg","Vandromme, Jean","Charlotte, Martin","32425315"],"abstract":["Background & objectives: This article examines whether women are less prone than men to Covid-19 infections and their complications.
