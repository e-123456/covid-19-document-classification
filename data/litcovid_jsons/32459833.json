We retrospectively collected data regarding demographics, comorbidities, medications, laboratory test results, radiology results, and outcomes associated with COVID-19. All five PLWH with COVID-19 were African American; 80% (4/5) were cisgender females. The mean age of patients was 48 years old (range 38-53). The majority of patients presented with cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Three patients had diarrhea. One patient presented with predominantly cardiac symptoms. All were taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) with CD4 count >200 cells/mm(3) and suppressed HIV viral loads at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. All five patients were hospitalized, two required supplemental oxygen, and none required mechanical ventilation. Four patients were treated with azithromycin and a cephalosporin and two were also treated with hydroxychloroquine. The median length of stay was 3 days (range 2-7). All patients recovered.
