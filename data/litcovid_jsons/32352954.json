In addition, early implementation of stringent isolation and protective measures after identification of two COVID-19 cases might have been effective in minimizing spread of the virus in this type of setting.

Limitations in effective infection control and prevention and staff members working in multiple facilities contributed to intra- and interfacility spread. COVID-19 can spread rapidly in long-term residential care facilities, and persons with chronic underlying medical conditions are at greater risk for COVID-19-associated severe disease and death. Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to protect the health of residents and preserve the health care workforce by identifying and excluding potentially infected staff members and visitors, ensuring early recognition of potentially infected patients, and implementing appropriate infection control measures."],"journal":"MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep","authors":["McMichael, Temet M","Clark, Shauna","Pogosjans, Sargis","Kay, Meagan","Lewis, James","Baer, Atar","Kawakami, Vance","Lukoff, Margaret D","Ferro, Jessica","Brostrom-Smith, Claire","Riedo, Francis X","Russell, Denny","Hiatt, Brian","Montgomery, Patricia","Rao, Agam K","Currie, Dustin W","Chow, Eric J","Tobolowsky, Farrell","Bardossy, Ana C","Oakley, Lisa P","Jacobs, Jesica R","Schwartz, Noah G","Stone, Nimalie","Reddy, Sujan C","Jernigan, John A","Honein, Margaret A","Clark, Thomas A","Duchin, Jeffrey S"],"date":"2020-03-28T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32214083","source":"PubMed","week":"202013|Mar 23 - Mar 29","doi":"10.15585/mmwr.mm6912e1","locations":["King County","Washington","Washington"],"countries":["United States"],"countries_codes":["USA|United States"],"topics":["Prevention"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138492341583874,"score":382.4487}]}
