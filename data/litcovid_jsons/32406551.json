PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were collected from patients attending the Urology emergency ward of CHUP during three weeks - from March 11th 2020 to April 1st 2020 - and from the same period the previous year (from March 11th to April 1st 2019). RESULTS: During the pandemic, 46.4% fewer patients visited our urological ED (122 vs 263). There was no significant difference of the mean age or the number of old patients (with 65 or more years old) between the two periods. However, significantly fewer female patients sought emergency urological services during the COVID-19 pandemic period (32.7% vs. 14.8%, p<0.05). No significant differences were noted between different clinical severity groups under the MTS. In 2019, significantly less patients required hospitalization.
