The present study seeks to understand the response of OHNS workflows in the context of policy changes and to contribute to developing preparatory guidelines for perioperative management in OHNS. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Pediatric and general adult academic medical centers and a Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: OHNS cases from March 18 to April 8, 2020-the 3 weeks immediately following the Ohio state-mandated suspension of all elective surgery on March 18, 2020-were compared with a 2019 control data set. RESULTS: During this time, OHNS at the general adult and pediatric medical centers and CCC experienced 87.8%, 77.1%, and 32% decreases in surgical procedures as compared with 2019, respectively. Aerosol-generating procedures accounted for 86.8% of general adult cases, 92.4% of pediatric cases, and 62.0% of CCC cases. Preoperative COVID-19 testing occurred in 7.1% of general adult, 9% of pediatric, and 6.9% of CCC cases. The majority of procedures were tiers 3a and 3b per the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Aerosol-protective personal protective equipment (PPE) was worn in 28.6% of general adult, 90% of pediatric, and 15.5% of CCC cases. CONCLUSION: For OHNS, the majority of essential surgical cases remained high-risk aerosol-generating procedures. Preoperative COVID-19 testing and intraoperative PPE usage were initially inconsistent; systemwide guidelines were developed rapidly but lagged behind recommendations of the OHNS department and its academy. OHNS best practice standards are needed for preoperative COVID-19 status screening and PPE usage as we begin national reopening.","Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg","Kuhar, Hannah N","Heilingoetter, Ashley","Bergman, Maxwell","Worobetz, Noah","Chiang, Tendy","Matrka, Laura","32482131"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: Limited research exists on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic pertaining to otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (OHNS).

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a large urban tertiary care medical center. Thirty-two patients undergoing operative procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic were placed into 2 preoperative screening protocols. Early in the pandemic a \"high-risk case protocol\" was utilized to maximize available resources. As information and technology evolved, a \"universal point-of-care protocol\" was implemented. RESULTS: Of 32 patients, 25 were screened prior to surgery. Three (12%) tested positive for COVID-19. In all 3 cases, the procedure was delayed, and patients were admitted for treatment or discharged under home quarantine. During this period, 86% of operative procedures were indicated for treatment of oncologic disease. There was no significant delay in arrival to the operating room for patients undergoing point-of-care screening immediately prior to their procedure (P = .92). DISCUSSION: Currently, few studies address preoperative screening for COVID-19. A substantial proportion of individuals in this cohort tested positive, and both protocols identified positive cases. The major strengths of the point-of-care protocol are ease of administration, avoiding subsequent exposures after testing, and relieving strain on \"COVID-19 clinics\" or other community testing facilities.
