METHOD: A retrospective, descriptive study of prospectively collected data in the Midland Trauma Registry in New Zealand. RESULTS: Overall there was a reduction of 43% in all injury-related admissions with significant reductions seen in major injury (50% reduction), males (50% reduction) and children aged 0-14 years (48% reduction). Results for ethnicity and persons aged over 14 years were within 3% deviation of this overall 43% reduction. Injuries at home, particularly falls, predominate. CONCLUSION: Despite the significant reduction in admissions during level 4 lockdown, hospitals should continue to provide full services until resource limitations are unavoidable. Immediate messaging is recommended to reduce rates of injury on the farm and at home, specifically falls prevention. Ongoing attention of road users to road safety is essential to reduce the incidence of preventable major injury.

The low reduction for PM10 is probably related to a significant regional contribution and the prevailing secondary origin of fine aerosols, but an in-depth evaluation has to be carried out to interpret this lower decrease. There is no defined trend for the low SO2 levels, probably due to the preferential reduction in emissions from the least polluting ships. A reduction of most pollutants to minimal concentrations are expected for the forthcoming weeks because of the more restrictive actions implemented for a total lockdown, which entered into force on March 30th.
