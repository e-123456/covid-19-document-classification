METHODS: PubMed.gov was searched for relevant articles using the keywords \"COVID-19\", \"coronavirus\", and \"SARS-CoV-2\" in conjunction with \"ophthalmology\" and \"eye\". Moreover, official recommendations of ophthalmological societies were systematically reviewed, with a focus on the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth). RESULTS: As of April 16, 2020, in total, 21 peer-reviewed articles on the ophthalmological aspects of COVID-19 were identified. Of these, 12 (57.1%) were from Asia, 6 (28.6%) from the United States of America, and 3 (14.3%) from Europe. There were 5 (23.8%) original studies, 10 (47.6%) letters, 3 (14.2%) case reports, and 3 (14.2%) reviews. These articles could be classified into the topics \"Modes and prevention of (ocular) transmission\", \"Ophthalmological manifestations of COVID-19\", \"Clinical guidance concerning ophthalmological practice during the COVID-19 pandemic\", and \"Practical recommendations for clinical infrastructure\". Practical recommendations could be extracted from official statements of the AAO and the RCOphth. CONCLUSION: Within a short period, a growing body of articles has started to elucidate the ophthalmological implications of COVID-19. As the eye can represent a route of infection (actively via tears and passively via the nasoacrimal duct), ophthalmological care has to undergo substantial modifications during this pandemic. In the eye, COVID-19 can manifest as keratoconjunctivitis.","Klin Monbl Augenheilkd","Siedlecki, Jakob","Brantl, Victor","Schworm, Benedikt","Mayer, Wolfgang Johann","Gerhardt, Maximilian","Michalakis, Stylianos","Kreutzer, Thomas","Priglinger, Siegfried","32375197"],"abstract":["PURPOSE: To perform a systematic analysis of articles on the ophthalmological implications of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Second, for outpatient care, a stringent dual screening and triaging process were carried out to identify high-risk patients, with proper isolation for such patients.
