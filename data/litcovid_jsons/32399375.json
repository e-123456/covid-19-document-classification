This study utilizes a nationwide survey to identify concerns held by students interested in pursuing neurosurgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Students who previously registered for the Medical Student Neurosurgery Training Camps were sent an online Qualtrics survey, requesting them to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic was affecting their neurosurgical education. The Pearson Chi-Square test and post-hoc pairwise Fisher's exact test were used for analysis of categorical variables and the two-tailed paired Student's t-test was utilized for continuous variables. Results: The survey was distributed to 852 medical students with 127 complete responses. Concerns regarding conferences/networking opportunities (63%), clinical experience (59%), and board exam scores (42%) were most frequently cited. 76% of M3s reported at least one cancelled/postponed neurosurgery rotation.

Biweekly virtual meetings were established wherein invited national and international spine care providers would deliver case-based presentations on spine and spine surgery-related conditions via teleconferencing. Promotion was coordinated through social media platforms such as Twitter. RESULTS: VGSC recruited over 1000 surgeons, trainees and other specialists, with 50-100 new registrants per week thereafter.
