Additionally, all urologic procedures performed by vascular interventional radiology (VIR) in May 2019 and March 2020 were included in the analysis. Case length, surgical and operating room staff present and number of articles of PPE were quantified. Articles of PPE were defined as surgical bonnet/hat and mask, and disposable or reusable gown with one pair of surgical gloves. RESULTS: 437 urologic and VIR procedures were included in the analysis. The mean PPE per case varied significantly between endoscopic and robotic categories. Robotic assisted laparoscopic cystectomy required the most hats and masks (14.5 per case in March 2019) whereas percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) tube placement by VIR required the fewest (3.1 in May 2019 and March 2020). CONCLUSIONS: PPE consumption varied significantly across urologic procedures. Robotic-assisted cases require the most PPE and PCN placement by VIR requires the fewest.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline numbers of ICU beds, ventilators, dialysis machines, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines, intravenous infusion pumps, and staff (senior medical staff, registered nurses); incremental capability to increase capacity (surge) by increasing ICU bed numbers; ventilator-to-bed ratios; number of ventilators in veterinary facilities.

The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the pandemic, and its corresponding State of Emergency, on a tertiary traumatology emergency service. Methods: : An observational study was performed at a tertiary hospital within the Spanish National Health System. Four different periods were studied, including the first 20 days of Spain's current State of Emergency, from March 14 to April 02, 2020 (Period 4). This period was compared to the 20-day period prior to the State of Emergency (Period 3), and to matching periods in the two previous years (Periods 1 and 2).

Variables collected included patient age and sex, insurance type, discharge destination and reason for hospital admission. Results: : The patients' mean age was 55.1 years old (Standard Deviation (SD): 22.1), and 51.8% were women (3495/6565). During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were significant reductions in total visits to the trauma emergency department, workplace accidents, traffic accidents and number of hospital admissions, particularly during Period 4.

Conclusions: : While most traumatological presentations decreased in frequency over the course of the outbreak, the number of osteoporotic hip fractures remained stable.
