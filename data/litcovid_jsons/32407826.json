This study aimed to investigate whether environmental contamination may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: Air samples were collected by natural precipitation, and environmental surface samples were collected by conventional surface swabbing. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was performed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Viral RNA was not detected in the 44 air samples. The positive rates in 200 environmental surface samples in medical areas (24.83%) was higher than that in living quarters (3.64%), with a significant difference (P<0.05). The positive rates were 25.00% and 37.50% for the general isolation ward and ICU, respectively, and no significant difference was observed between them (P=0.238). The top five sampling sites with a positive rate in medical areas were beepers (50.00%), water machine buttons (50.00%), elevator buttons (42.86%), computer mouses (40.00%), and telephones (40.00%).
