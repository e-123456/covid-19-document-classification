The suspected contribution of thrombotic events to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients has prompted a search for novel potential options for preventing COVID-19-associated thrombotic disease. In this article by the Global COVID-19 Thrombosis Collaborative Group, we describe novel dosing approaches for commonly used antithrombotic agents (especially heparin-based regimens) and the potential use of less widely used antithrombotic drugs in the absence of confirmed thrombosis. Although these therapies may have direct antithrombotic effects, other mechanisms of action, including anti-inflammatory or antiviral effects, have been postulated. Based on survey results from this group of authors, we suggest research priorities for specific agents and subgroups of patients with COVID-19. Further, we review other agents, including immunomodulators, that may have antithrombotic properties. It is our hope that the present document will encourage and stimulate future prospective studies and randomized trials to study the safety, efficacy, and optimal use of these agents for prevention or management of thrombosis in COVID-19.","Thromb Haemost","Bikdeli, Behnood","Madhavan, Mahesh V","Gupta, Aakriti","Jimenez, David","Burton, John R","Der Nigoghossian, Caroline","Chuich, Taylor","Nouri, Shayan Nabavi","Dreyfus, Isaac","Driggin, Elissa","Sethi, Sanjum","Sehgal, Kartik","Chatterjee, Saurav","Ageno, Walter","Madjid, Mohammad","Guo, Yutao","Tang, Liang V","Hu, Yu","Bertoletti, Laurent","Giri, Jay","Cushman, Mary","Quere, Isabelle","Dimakakos, Evangelos P","Gibson, C Michael","Lippi, Giuseppe","Favaloro, Emmanuel J","Fareed, Jawed","Tafur, Alfonso J","Francese, Dominic P","Batra, Jaya","Falanga, Anna","Clerkin, Kevin J","Uriel, Nir","Kirtane, Ajay","McLintock, Claire","Hunt, Beverley J","Spyropoulos, Alex C","Barnes, Geoffrey D","Eikelboom, John W","Weinberg, Ido","Schulman, Sam","Carrier, Marc","Piazza, Gregory","Beckman, Joshua A","Leon, Martin B","Stone, Gregg W","Rosenkranz, Stephan","Goldhaber, Samuel Z","Parikh, Sahil A","Monreal, Manuel","Krumholz, Harlan M","Konstantinides, Stavros V","Weitz, Jeffrey I","Lip, Gregory Y H","32473596"],"abstract":["Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), currently a worldwide pandemic, is a viral illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

In the initial phase of the infection, D-dimer and fibrinogen levels are increased, while activated partial prothrombin time, prothrombin time, and platelet counts are often relatively normal.
