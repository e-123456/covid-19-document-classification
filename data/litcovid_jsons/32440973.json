Brazil accounts for almost half of Latin American HIV cases and Rio de Janeiro is the city with the second largest number of AIDS. Clinical appointments and pharmacy antiretroviral refills may be impaired due to restricted traffic and possible lockdowns, preventing people living with HIV and those using PrEP from accessing needed antiretrovirals. We hereby describe the telemedicine procedures implemented in a large PrEP delivery in Rio de janeiro in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the initial teleconsultation, individuals undergoe HIV rapid testing and are assessed by phone for PrEP related procedures. Individuals receive a digital prescription to retrieve a 120-day PrEP supply plus two HIV self-test kits. Subsequent follow-up teleconsultations will be performed remotely by phone call, including instructions for the HIV self-test performance, which results are to be sent using a digital picture. Participants will attend the service only for PrEP refill. The use of telemedicine procedures is being effective to avoid PrEP shortage and reduce the time PrEP users spend at the service during the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing recommendations.","Braz J Infect Dis","Hoagland, Brenda","Torres, Thiago S","Bezerra, Daniel R B","Geraldo, Kim","Pimenta, Cristina","Veloso, Valdilea G","Grinsztejn, Beatriz","32504552"],"abstract":["COVID-19 public health responses such as social distancing and community containment measures protocols are critical to preventing and containing the spread of coronavirus.
