The most common dermatologic diseases in patients with COVID-19 who have dermatologic diseases for the last three years were superficial fungal infections (24, 25.8%), seborrheic dermatitis (11, 11.8%), actinic keratosis (10, 10.8%), psoriasis (6, 6.5%) and eczema (6, 6.5%), respectively. In addition, the number of COVID-19 patients who presented to dermatology in the last three months was 17 (11 men, 6 women). The median age of these patients was 58 (minimum 18, maximum 80) years, and the most common dermatologic diseases before diagnosed COVID-19 were superficial fungal infections (5, 25%), psoriasis (4, 20%), and viral skin diseases (3, 15%).
