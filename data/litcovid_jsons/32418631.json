Surgical Departments need to adapt to this change. METHODS: We performed a prospective descriptive observational study of the incidence of COVID-19 in patients and surgeons of a General Surgical Department in a high prevalence area, between the 1st and 31st of March 2020. RESULTS: Patients: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in elective surgery patients was 7% (mean age 59.5 years). All survived. Of 36 patients who underwent emergency surgery, two of them were SARS-CoV-2 positive and one was clinically highly suspicious of COVID-19 (11.1%). All three patients died of respiratory failure (mean age 81 years). Surgeons: There were a total of 12 confirmed SARS-CoV-2+ cases among the surgical department staff (24.4%) (8 out of 34 consultants and 4 out of 15 residents). Healthcare activity: The average number of daily emergency surgical interventions declined from 3.6 in February to 1.16 in March. 42% of the patients who underwent emergency surgery had peritonitis upon presentation. CONCLUSIONS: The fast pace of COVID-19 pandemia should alert surgical departments of the need of adopting early measures to ensure the safety of patients and staff.","Cir Esp","Alvarez Gallego, Mario","Gortazar de Las Casas, Sara","Pascual Miguelanez, Isabel","Rubio-Perez, Ines","Barragan Serrano, Cristina","Alvarez Pena, Estibaliz","Diaz Dominguez, Joaquin","32336467"],"abstract":["INTRODUCTION: The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection has led to a radical reorganization of healthcare resources.
