Current evidence indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 strain of coronavirus is mainly transmitted by droplets either by direct or indirect contact. The duration of infectiousness of COVID-19 ranges from 1-2 days before and 7-10 days after the onset of symptoms. It is often difficult to detect the signs and symptoms of infection and to implement timely intervention during the very early stage of infection. Thus, finding and isolating symptomatic patients may not be sufficient to contain this epidemic. Therefore, it is very important to wear masks, take personal precautions, and practice recommended social distancing to achieve source control and stop transmission. Taiwan has learned from its previous experience with the SARS epidemic and prepared for the potential of new disease outbreaks for at least 17 years. This helped the government to implement a multifaceted strategy in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Taiwan's effective response has made the country a model for pandemic response policy that has been appreciated internationally. This paper examines COVID-19 epidemic prevention from the perspective of infection control strategies. In Taiwan, hospital infection control, which is practiced nationwide, emphasizes the importance to epidemic prevention of collecting and tracking travel history, occupation, contact history, cluster (TOCC) information; practicing hand hygiene; promoting the correct use of personal protective equipment; and maintaining safe distances from others.

Accordingly, 1.83-m (6-feet) social distancing is advised to reduce the spread of the disease among humans. This is based on the assumption that no air circulation exists around people. However, it is not well investigated whether the ambient wind and relative humidity (RH) will cause SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets to transport farther in the air, making the current social distancing policy insufficient. To provide evidence and insight into the \"social distancing\" guidelines, a validated computational fluid-particle dynamics (CFPD) model was employed to simulate the transient transport, condensation/evaporation, and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets emitted by coughs, with different environmental wind velocities and RHs. Initial droplet diameters range from 2 to 2000mum, and the wind velocities range from 0 to 16km/h, representing different wind forces from calm air to moderate breeze. The comparison between a steady-state wind and a gust with a constant frequency has also been performed. Ambient RHs are 40% and 99.5%. The distances between the two virtual humans are 1.83m and 3.05m (6 feet and 10 feet). The facial covering effect on reducing the airborne transmission of the cough droplets has also been evaluated. Numerical results indicate that the ambient wind will enhance the complexity of the secondary flows with recirculation between the two virtual humans. Microdroplets follow the airflow streamlines well and deposit on both human bodies and head regions, even with the 3.05-m (10-feet) separation distance. The rest of the microdroplets can transport in the air farther than 3.05m (10 feet) due to wind convection, causing a potential health risk to nearby people. High RH will increase the droplet sizes due to the hygroscopic growth effect, which increases the deposition fractions on both humans and the ground. With the complex environmental wind and RH conditions, the 6-feet social distancing policy may not be sufficient to protect the inter-person aerosol transmission, since the suspending micro-droplets were influenced by convection effects and can be transported from the human coughs/sneezes to the other human in less than 5s. Thus, due to the complex real-world environmental ventilation conditions, a social distance longer than 6 feet needs to be considered.
