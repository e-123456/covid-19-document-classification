STUDY DESIGN: This is a descriptive study outlining the strategy of a single academic health system for addressing 4 critical issues facing surgical departments during the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) developing a cohesive leadership team and system for frequent communication throughout the department; (2) ensuring adequate hospital capacity to care for an anticipated influx of COVID-19 patients; (3) safeguarding supplies of blood products and personal protective equipment to protect patients and providers; and (4) preparing for an unstable workforce due to illness and competing personal priorities such as childcare. RESULTS: Through collaborative efforts within the Department of Surgery and Hospital, we provided concise and regular communication, reduced operating room volume by 80%, secured a 4-week supply of personal protective equipment, and created reduced staffing protocols with back-up staffing plans.
