High morbidity and mortality rates of COVID-19 have been observed among older adults, and this has been widely reported in both mainstream and social media. The objective of this study was to analyze tweets related to COVID-19 and older adults, and to identify ageist content. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: We obtained a representative sample of original tweets posted between March 12 and March 21, 2020, containing the keywords \"elderly\", \"older\", and/or \"boomer\" plus the hashtags \"#COVID19\" and/or \"#coronavirus\". MEASUREMENTS: We identified the type of user and number of followers for each account. Tweets were classified by three raters as: 1) informative; 2) personal accounts; 3) personal opinions; 4) advice seeking; 5) jokes; and 6) miscellaneous. Potentially offensive content, as well as that downplaying the severity of COVID-19 because it mostly affects older adults, was identified. RESULTS: 18,128 tweets were obtained, of which a random sample of 351 was analyzed. Most accounts (91.7%) belonged to individuals. The most common types of tweets were personal opinions (31.9%), followed by informative tweets (29.6%), jokes/ridicule (14.3%), and personal accounts (13.4%). Seventy-seven tweets (21.9%) likely intended to ridicule or offend someone, while 21.1% had content which implied that the life of older adults was less valuable, or downplayed the relevance of COVID-19.
