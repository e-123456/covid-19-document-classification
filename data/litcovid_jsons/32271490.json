The possibility that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might cause olfactory dysfunction is certainly plausible. Patients presenting to specialized smell clinics are commonly diagnosed with upper respiratory infection (URI)-associated olfactory loss and most are presumed to be viral related. In acute phases of infection, it is common to experience some smell loss as a result of nasal inflammation, mucosal edema, and obstruction of airflow into the olfactory cleft. In most cases, these episodes of smell loss are self-limiting and coincide with resolution of URI symptoms. However, in some cases the smell loss persists for months to years and this is presumed to occur through a more direct olfactory insult by the virus. It remains too early to know whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes persistent olfactory dysfunction. However, given the scale of this pandemic, if SARS-CoV-2 does cause chronic olfactory loss in even a small portion of those infected, then the overall population prevalence could be quite large. This review provides a brief, practical overview of viral-associated olfactory loss, realizing that evidence related to COVID-19 will likely not be clear for some time. Our goal is to highlight the existence and importance of this condition and provide information geared for both providers and patients. Practical suggestions regarding evaluation and treatment will be provided, realizing that there may be constraints on medical resources and the nature of this pandemic remains dynamic.

METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited from 12 European hospitals. The following epidemiological and clinical outcomes have been studied: age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and general and otolaryngological symptoms. Patients completed olfactory and gustatory questionnaires based on the smell and taste component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS). RESULTS: A total of 417 mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients completed the study (263 females). The most prevalent general symptoms consisted of cough, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Face pain and nasal obstruction were the most disease-related otolaryngological symptoms. 85.6% and 88.0% of patients reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively. There was a significant association between both disorders (p < 0.001). Olfactory dysfunction (OD) appeared before the other symptoms in 11.8% of cases.

METHODS: A single-institution, cross-sectional study evaluating patient-reported symptoms with a focus on smell and taste was conducted using an internet-based platform on adult subjects who underwent testing for Covid-19. Logistic regression was employed to identify symptoms associated with Covid-19 positivity. RESULTS: A total of 1480 patients with influenza-like symptoms underwent Covid-19 testing between March 3 through 29, 2020. Our study captured 59 of 102 (58%) Covid-19-positive patients and 203 of 1378 (15%) Covid-19-negative patients. Smell and taste loss were reported in 68% (40/59) and 71% (42/59) of Covid-19-positive subjects, respectively, compared to 16% (33/203) and 17% (35/203) of Covid-19-negative patients (p<0.001). Smell and taste impairment were independently and strongly associated with Covid-19-positivity (anosmia: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 10.9, 95%CI:5.08-23.5; ageusia: aOR 10.2 95%CI:4.74-22.1); whereas, sore throat was associated with Covid-19-negativity (aOR 0.23, 95%CI:0.11-0.50). Of patients who reported Covid-19-associated loss of smell, 74% (28/38) reported resolution of anosmia with clinical resolution of illness.
