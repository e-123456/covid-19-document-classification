A paired t-test was used to identify any significant change on six 7-point Likert scale questions with alpha< 0.05 (95% confidence interval). RESULTS: All six of the questions - 1) \"I feel confident managing a real laboratory sample test for Ebola or other highly contagious sample;\" 2) \"I feel safe working in the lab environment during a real scenario;\" 3) \"I feel as if I can appropriately manage a potentially highly contagious laboratory sample;\" 4)\"I feel that I can interpret a positive or negative sample during a suspected contagious outbreak;\" 5) \"I understand basic Biobubble/mobile laboratory concepts and procedures;\" and 6) \"I understand polymerase chain reaction (PCR) principles\" - showed statistical significant change pre and post training.
