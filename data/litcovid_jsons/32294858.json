Methods: From January 13, 2020 to January 31, 2020, a total of 33 patients with 2019-nCoV infection diagnosed and treated by Suzhou Fifth People's Hospital were analyzed retrospectively, including 20 males and 13 females, with an average age of (50+/-12) years, ranging from 20 to 70 years old. There were 3 cases of mild type, 27 cases of common type and 3 cases of severe type.There were 2 cases with hypertension, 1 case with postoperative lung,1 case with diabetes, 1 case with chronic bronchitis, and 1 case with bronchiectasis.SPSS25.0 Chi-square test was used to analyze the distribution of lesions in each lung lobe; SPSS25.0 Spearman correlation coefficient was used to analyze the image score and clinical classification. Results: There were 3 cases (9.1%) with normal lung and 30 cases (90.9%) with Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia(COVID-19) of the 2019-nCoV infected patients. In the distribution of COVID-19, 29 cases (87.9%) were involved in bilateral lung and 1 case (3.0%) in unilateral lung. There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of lesions in each lobe. The correlation coefficient between the degree of lesion distribution and clinical classification was 0.819, and the two were highly correlated.There were 30 cases (90.9%) with subpleural lesions, 17 cases (51.5%) with central lesions. There were many kinds of lesions, 25 cases (75.8%) had ground glass density shadow, 16 cases (48.5%) had consolidation, 12 cases (36.4%) had interstitial change, and 18 cases (54.5%) had interlobular septal thickening. Among the 22 cases, 10 cases had more lesions, 6 cases had no changes and 6 cases had less lesions. Conclusion: Most of the patients with 2019-nCoV infection have pulmonary inflammation.CT manifestations include multiple parts, subpleural area or middle and lateral field of lung, ground glass shadow and consolidation, or coexistence.

Patients were divided into 3 types based on Chinese guideline: mild (patients with minimal symptoms and negative CT findings), common, and severe-critical (patients with positive CT findings and different extent of clinical manifestations). CT visual quantitative evaluation was based on summing up the acute lung inflammatory lesions involving each lobe, which was scored as 0 (0%), 1 (1-25%), 2 (26-50%), 3 (51-75%), or 4 (76-100%), respectively. The total severity score (TSS) was reached by summing the five lobe scores. The consistency of two observers was evaluated. The TSS was compared with the clinical classification. ROC was used to test the diagnosis ability of TSS for severe-critical type. RESULTS: This study included 78 patients, 38 males and 40 females. There were 24 mild (30.8%), 46 common (59.0%), and 8 severe-critical (10.2%) cases, respectively. The median TSS of severe-critical-type group was significantly higher than common type (p < 0.001).
