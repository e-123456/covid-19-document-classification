During remote-visits several interventions were conducted: triage for COVID-19 suspected symptoms, email check of clinical pictures and of laboratory examinations, advices for topical and systemic therapy continuation or discontinuation/switch and re-schedule of next appointment. Only 5 patients required personal office visit (2.6%), reducing consistently the number of face-to face visits.
