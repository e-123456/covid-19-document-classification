The special issue is published in a special time in which science-based approaches, co-creation based collaboration, and the effective utilization and integration of competences have a crucial role during the race against time while combating the COVID-19 pandemic. In this process, the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK), which publishes academic journals including the Turkish Journal of Medical Sciences, has taken rapid action to mobilize the research community. This includes forming new scientific coalitions in record time, the opening of new calls across the research ecosystem, the organization of a virtual scientific conference, and the launch of a new portal in support of co-creation processes and open science. In addition, various teleconferences have taken place that brings together various disciplines at the national and international level.

We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time. The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative. International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial. An immediate priority is collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups, and on brain function, cognition, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required. Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience.
