Various simulation-based studies have been conducted in the past to investigate the effectiveness of such measures. While those studies unanimously confirm the mitigating effect of social distancing on the disease spread, the reported effectiveness varies from 10% to more than 90% reduction in the number of infections. This level of uncertainty is mostly due to the complex dynamics of epidemics and their time-variant parameters. A real transactional data, however, can reduce the uncertainty and provide a less noisy picture of social distancing effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we integrate multiple transactional data sets (GPS mobility data from Google and Apple as well as disease statistics data from ECDC) to study the role of social distancing policies in 26 countries wherein the transmission rate of the COVID-19 pandemic is analyzed over the course of five weeks. METHODS: Relying on the SIR model and official COVID-19 reports, we first calculated the weekly transmission rate (beta) of the coronavirus disease in 26 countries for five consecutive weeks. Then we integrated that with the Google's and Apple's mobility data sets for the same time frame and used a machine learning approach to investigate the relationship between mobility factors and beta values. RESULTS: Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) regression analysis showed that changes in mobility patterns, resulted from social distancing policies, explain around 47% of the variation in the disease transmission rate. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with simulation-based studies, real cross-national transactional data confirms the effectiveness of social distancing interventions in slowing down the spread of the disease. Apart from providing less noisy and more generalizable support for the whole social distancing idea, we provide specific insights for public health policy-makers as to what locations should be given a higher priority for enforcing social distancing measures.

In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antivirals, strategies for controlling and mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing, contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation, and the use of face-masks in public. We develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies. Rigorous analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is locally-asymptotically stable if a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number (denoted by c), is less than unity. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the US state of New York and the entire US, show that the pandemic burden will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%, respectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are maintained until the end of May or June, 2020. The duration and timing of the relaxation or termination of the strict social-distancing measures are crucially-important in determining the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study shows that early termination of the strict social-distancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to those projected before the onset of the strict social-distancing measures were implemented. The use of efficacious face-masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy >/= 70%) in public could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents of New York state use such masks in public consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at least 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks, such as cloth masks (of estimated efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of the other anti-COVID-19 intervention strategies can lead to the elimination of the pandemic. This study emphasizes the important role social-distancing plays in curtailing the burden of COVID-19. Increases in the adherence level of social-distancing protocols result in dramatic reduction of the burden of the pandemic, and the timely implementation of social-distancing measures in numerous states of the US may have averted a catastrophic outcome with respect to the burden of COVID-19.
