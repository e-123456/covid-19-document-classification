Little is known about the psychological aspects, particularly for vulnerable populations including pregnant women.Objectives: To understand the attitude, concerns, and knowledge of the non-infected pregnant women toward the COVID-19 outbreak in order to constitute base data for detailed counseling and to develop targeted messages.Patients and methods: This cross-sectional survey research presented analysis of prospectively collected data yielded at a single tertiary \"Coronavirus Pandemic Hospital\" referral center for a ten days period following the first confirmed death due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. Non-infected women with a confirmed pregnancy over 30th gestational week were consecutively included. A patient-reported non-validated questionnaire formed by the expert committee that includes 15 specific questions was used. Non-infected, pregnant women over 30th gestational week who applied to the outpatient clinic were consecutively included. A total of 213 women were enrolled, 37 were excluded: 7 for being in the first trimester, 3 were illiterate, and 27 were Syrian refugees having difficulties in translation.Results: A total of 172 pregnant women were included. Overall, four women refused to participate to the survey (1.9%). The mean age was 27.5 +/- 5.3 years. Median gestational week and parity were 35 +/- 11 weeks and 1 +/- 2, respectively. Pregnant women were observed to trust the authorities (65%) and the healthcare staff (92.4%), and their respect was increased (82.5%) during the outbreak. Majority of the women (87.2%) comply with the self-quarantine rules. Half of the women (52%) reported that they felt vulnerable and predominantly were concerned (80%). Approximately one-third of the women constantly keep thinking that they may get infected (35.5%) or they might get infected during/following the delivery or their baby might get infected after being born (42%). Half of the women (50%) were reported that they either had no idea about or think the breastfeeding is not safe during the outbreak. About 45% of the women were confused or had doubts about if the mode of delivery may be affected by the pandemic. Greater part of the participants does not know if COVID-19 might cause birth defects (76%) or preterm birth (64.5%).
