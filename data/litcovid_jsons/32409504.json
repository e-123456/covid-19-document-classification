We aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes and to analyze the risk factors for in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This two-center retrospective study was performed at two tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, China. Confirmed COVID-19 patients with diabetes (N = 153) who were discharged or died from 1 January 2020 to 8 March 2020 were identified. One sex- and age-matched COVID-19 patient without diabetes was randomly selected for each patient with diabetes. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were abstracted. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with the mortality in these patients. RESULTS: Of 1,561 COVID-19 patients, 153 (9.8%) had diabetes, with a median age of 64.0 (interquartile range 56.0-72.0) years.

The median age of patients was 44.0 years (interquartile range, 33.0-54.0). 55 (27.2%) patients had comorbidities. At the onset of illness, the common symptoms were fever (156 [77.2%]) and cough (120 [59.4%]). 66 (32.7%) patients had lymphopenia. 193 (95.5%) patients had abnormal radiological findings. 11 (5.4%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit and none of the patients died. 23 (11.4%) patients had severe illness. Severe illness of COVID-19 was independently associated with body mass index (BMI) >/= 28 kg/m2 (odds ratio [OR], 9.219; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.731 to 31.126; P<0.001) and a known history of type 2 diabetes (OR, 4.326; 95% CI, 1.059 to 17.668; P = 0.041). In this case series in Jiangsu Province, COVID-19 patients had less severe symptoms and had better outcomes than the initial COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. The BMI >/= 28 kg/m2 and a known history of type 2 diabetes were independent risk factors of severe illness in patients with COVID-19."],"journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","authors":["Huang, Rui","Zhu, Li","Xue, Leyang","Liu, Longgen","Yan, Xuebing","Wang, Jian","Zhang, Biao","Xu, Tianmin","Ji, Fang","Zhao, Yun","Cheng, Juan","Wang, Yinling","Shao, Huaping","Hong, Shuqin","Cao, Qi","Li, Chunyang","Zhao, Xiang-An","Zou, Lei","Sang, Dawen","Zhao, Haiyan","Guan, Xinying","Chen, Xiaobing","Shan, Chun","Xia, Juan","Chen, Yuxin","Yan, Xiaomin","Wei, Jie","Zhu, Chuanwu","Wu, Chao"],"date":"2020-05-09T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32384078","source":"PubMed","week":"202019|May 04 - May 10","doi":"10.1371/journal.pntd.0008280","locations":["Wuhan","Jiangsu","China","Jiangsu","China","Jiangsu","Wuhan","Jiangsu","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Treatment","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666267276765036544,"score":216.98708}]}
