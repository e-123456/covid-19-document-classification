METHODS: A total of 132 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan, China from January 18, 2020 to February 26, 2020 were collected. The dynamic changes of blood SAA, CRP, PCT, WBC, Lymphocyte (L), PLT, CT imaging, and disease progression were studied. All patients completed at least twice laboratory data collection and clinical condition assessment at three time points indicated for this study; The length of hospital stay was longer than 14 days prior to February 26, 2020. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients had significantly increased SAA and CRP levels, while L count decreased, and PCT, WBC, and PLT were in the normal range. As disease progressed from mild to critically severe, SAA and CRP gradually increased, while L decreased, and PLT, WBC, and PCT had no significant changes; ROC curve analysis suggests that SAA/L, CRP, SAA, and L count are valuable in evaluating the severity of COVID-19 and distinguishing critically ill patients from mild ones; Patients with SAA consistently trending down during the course of disease have better prognosis, compared with the patients with SAA continuously rising; The initial SAA level is positively correlated with the dynamic changes of the serial CT scans.

The observation indicators included total blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), arterial blood gas analysis, myocardial injury markers, coagulation function, liver and kidney function, electrolyte, procalcitonin (PCT), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), blood lipid, pulmonary CT and pathogen detection. Results: Compared with the general group, the lymphocyte count (0.74x10(9) (0.34x10(9), 0.94x10(9))/L vs. 0.99x10(9) (0.71x10(9), 1.29x10(9))/L, P=0.03) was extremely lower in the critical group, CRP (106.98 (81.57, 135.76) mg/L vs. 34.34 (9.55,76.54) mg/L, P<0.001) and PCT (0.20 (0.15,0.48) mug/L vs. 0.11 (0.06,0.20)mug/L, P<0.001) were significantly higher in the critical group. The BMI of the critical group was significantly higher than that of the general group (25.5 (23.0, 27.5) kg/m(2) vs. 22.0 (20.0, 24.0) kg/m(2), P=0.003). Patients were further divided into non-survivor group (17, 15.18%) group and survivor group (95, 84.82%).

Compared with the survived patients, oxygenation index (130 (102, 415) vs. 434 (410, 444), P<0.001) was significantly lower and lactic acid (1.70 (1.30, 3.00) mmol/L vs. 1.20 (1.10, 1.60) mmol/L, P<0.001) was significantly higher in the non-survivors. There was no significant difference in the proportion of ACEI/ARB medication between the critical group and the general group or between non-survivors and survivors (all P>0.05). Conclusion: COVID-19 patients combined with CVD are associated with a higher risk of mortality. Critical patients are characterized with lower lymphocyte counts. Higher BMI are more often seen in critical patients and non-survivor. ACEI/ARB use does not affect the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 combined with CVD.

They were divided into critical group (ICU, n=16) and general group (n=96) according to the severity of the disease and patients were followed up to the clinical endpoint. The observation indicators included total blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), arterial blood gas analysis, myocardial injury markers, coagulation function, liver and kidney function, electrolyte, procalcitonin (PCT), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), blood lipid, pulmonary CT and pathogen detection. Results: Compared with the general group, the lymphocyte count (0.74x10(9) (0.34x10(9), 0.94x10(9))/L vs. 0.99x10(9) (0.71x10(9), 1.29x10(9))/L, P=0.03) was extremely lower in the critical group, CRP (106.98 (81.57, 135.76) mg/L vs. 34.34 (9.55,76.54) mg/L, P<0.001) and PCT (0.20 (0.15,0.48) mug/L vs. 0.11 (0.06,0.20)mug/L, P<0.001) were significantly higher in the critical group. The BMI of the critical group was significantly higher than that of the general group (25.5 (23.0, 27.5) kg/m(2) vs. 22.0 (20.0, 24.0) kg/m(2), P=0.003). Patients were further divided into non-survivor group (17, 15.18%) group and survivor group (95, 84.82%). Among the non-survivors, there were 88.24% (15/17) patients with BMI> 25 kg/m(2), which was significantly higher than that of survivors (18.95% (18/95), P<0.001). Compared with the survived patients, oxygenation index (130 (102, 415) vs. 434 (410, 444), P<0.001) was significantly lower and lactic acid (1.70 (1.30, 3.00) mmol/L vs. 1.20 (1.10, 1.60) mmol/L, P<0.001) was significantly higher in the non-survivors. There was no significant difference in the proportion of ACEI/ARB medication between the critical group and the general group or between non-survivors and survivors (all P>0.05). Conclusion: COVID-19 patients combined with CVD are associated with a higher risk of mortality. Critical patients are characterized with lower lymphocyte counts. Higher BMI are more often seen in critical patients and non-survivor. ACEI/ARB use does not affect the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 combined with CVD. Aggravating causes of death include fulminant inflammation, lactic acid accumulation and thrombotic events."],"journal":"Zhonghua Xin Xue Guan Bing Za Zhi","authors":["Peng, Y D","Meng, K","Guan, H Q","Leng, L","Zhu, R R","Wang, B Y","He, M A","Cheng, L X","Huang, K","Zeng, Q T"],"date":"2020-03-03T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32120458","week":"202010|Mar 02 - Mar 08","doi":"10.3760/cma.j.cn112148-20200220-00105","keywords":["COVID-19","Cardiovascular diseases","Treatment outcome"],"source":"PubMed","locations":["P=0.03","Wuhan"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Treatment","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"e_drugs":["Lactic Acid","Lipids"],"_version_":1663352134310035456,"score":324.57404}]}
