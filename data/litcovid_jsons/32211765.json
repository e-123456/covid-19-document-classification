METHODS: On 2020-02-29 we performed a Google search with the terms \"Prevention coronavirus\", \"Prevention COVID-19\", \"Prevencion coronavirus\", and \"Prevencion COVID-19\". A univariate analysis was performed to study the association between the type of authorship, and country of publication, and recommendations to avoid COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization. RESULTS: In total, 80 weblinks were reviewed. Most of them were produced in the USA and Spain (72.5%), by digital media and official public health organizations (75.1%).
