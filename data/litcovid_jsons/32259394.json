Iran is one of the ten most affected countries. Search engines provide useful data from populations and this data might be useful to analyze epidemics. Utilizing data mining methods on electronic resources' data might give better insight to manage the health crisis of coronavirus outbreak for each country and the world. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed to predict the incidence of COVID-19 in Iran. METHODS: The data is obtained from the Google Trend website. Linear regression and long short-term memory (LSTM) models have been used to estimate the number of positive COVID-19 cases. All models are evaluated using 10-fold-cross validation, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used as the performance metric. RESULTS: The Linear Regression model predicts the incidence with an RMSE of 7.562 +/- 6.492. The most effective factors besides previous day incidence include the searches' frequency of handwashing, hand sanitizer, and antiseptic topics. The RMSE of the LSTM model was equal to 27.187.

After about 10 years, in 2012, another similar coronavirus triggered the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia.

It spread rapidly and to date has killed 3,242 persons with more than 81,000 cases of infection in China and causing over 126,000 global cases and 5,414 deaths in 166 other countries around the world, especially Italy.
