The platelet count reflects the thrombocyte turnover, acting as a sensitive indicator of illness severity that is of great clinical utility to monitor a quickly changing health condition of patients affected by aggressive viral infections. This study aims to investigate the significance of platelet count during the progression of the disease in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of 532 COVID-19 patients were involved in the cohort study from the First People's Hospital of Jiangxia District in Wuhan from January 7, 2020, to February 28, 2020. We collected the clinical characteristics and laboratory data of patients. Patients still hospitalized before February 29, 2020, died on admission, with malignant tumors, previous gastrointestinal surgery, missing baseline platelet count, or platelet count detected only once, were excluded. We used a generalized additive model and generalized additive mixed model to compare trends in platelet count over time among survivors and non-survivors, with an adjustment for potential confounders. Results: During the follow-up, twenty-nine subjects died (mortality rate, 5.45%). The platelets among non-survivors decreased and among survivors increased gradually within 1 week after admission.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate the risk factors of developing severe disease. The objective of the study was to reveal the risk factors of developing severe disease by comparing the differences in the hemocyte count and dynamic profiles in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. Methods In this retrospectively analyzed cohort, 141 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled in Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Taizhou Hospital, Zhejiang Province, China, from January 17, 2020 to February 26, 2020. Clinical characteristics and hemocyte counts of severe and non-severe COVID patients were collected. The differences in the hemocyte counts and dynamic profiles in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 were compared. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify potential biomarkers for predicting disease progression. A concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, decision curve and the clinical impact curve were calculated to assess the predictive accuracy.
