The conventional therapeutic use of Nigella sativa, in different ways, has been reported in several studies to treat different diseases including influenza, headache, hypertension, diabetes, inflammation, eczema, fever, cough, asthma, bronchitis, and fever. Based on previously reported potential therapeutic uses of N. sativa compounds, and keeping in mind the dire need of time for the development of potent antiviral, a combined docking, ADMET properties calculation, molecular dynamics, and MM-PBSA approaches were applied in the current study to check the therapeutic potentials of N. sativa chief constituents against COVID-19. Among the studied compounds, we found that dithymoquinone (DTQ), with binding affinity of -8.6 kcal/mol compared to a positive control (chloroquine, -7.2 kcal/mol) , has the high potential of binding at SARS-CoV-2:ACE2 interface and thus could be predicted a plausible inhibitor to disrupt viral-host interactions. Molecular dynamics simulation of 100 ns well complemented binding affinity of the compound and revealed strong stability of DTQ at the docked site.

In the present work, we have elucidated the mechanism of binding of two inhibitors, namely alpha-ketoamide and Z31792168, to SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro) or 3CL(pro)) by using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations. We calculated the total binding free energy (DeltaGbind) of both inhibitors and further decomposed DeltaGbind into various forces governing the complex formation using the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) method. Our calculations reveal that alpha-ketoamide is more potent (DeltaGbind= - 9.05 kcal/mol) compared to Z31792168 (DeltaGbind= - 3.25 kcal/mol) against COVID-19 3CL(pro). The increase in DeltaGbind for alpha-ketoamide relative to Z31792168 arises due to an increase in the favorable electrostatic and van der Waals interactions between the inhibitor and 3CL(pro). Further, we have identified important residues controlling the 3CL(pro)-ligand binding from per-residue based decomposition of the binding free energy. Finally, we have compared DeltaGbind of these two inhibitors with the anti-HIV retroviral drugs, such as lopinavir and darunavir. It is observed that alpha-ketoamide is more potent compared to lopinavir and darunavir. In the case of lopinavir, a decrease in van der Waals interactions is responsible for the lower binding affinity compared to alpha-ketoamide. On the other hand, in the case of darunavir, a decrease in the favorable intermolecular electrostatic and van der Waals interactions contributes to lower affinity compared to alpha-ketoamide.
