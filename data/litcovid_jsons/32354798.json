METHODS: We prospectively assessed the medical records, laboratory results, chest CT images and use of medication in a cohort of patients presenting to two designated covid-19 treatment centres in Sichuan, China. Outcomes of interest included death, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, treatment with vasoactive agents and classification of disease severity.

RESULTS: A total of 101 cases were enrolled from January to 10 March 2020 (average age 49 years, IQR 34-62 years). Acute myocardial injury was present in 15.8% of patients, nearly half of whom had a hs-TnT value fivefold greater than the normal upper limit.

The elevation in cardiac markers was probably due to secondary and systemic consequences and can be considered as the warning sign for recent adverse clinical outcomes of the patients."],"journal":"Int J Cardiol","authors":["Deng, Qing","Hu, Bo","Zhang, Yao","Wang, Hao","Zhou, Xiaoyang","Hu, Wei","Cheng, Yuting","Yan, Jie","Ping, Haiqin","Zhou, Qing"],"date":"2020-04-16T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32291207","source":"PubMed","week":"202016|Apr 13 - Apr 19","doi":"10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.03.087","keywords":["covid-19","cardiac marker","myocardial injury","myocarditis","novel coronavirus"],"locations":["Wuhan","China","Wuhan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138494402035712,"score":213.60487}]}
