MATERIALS AND METHODS: The complete clinical and imaging data of 114 confirmed COVID-19 patients treated in Xiaogan Hospital were analysed retrospectively. Data were gathered regarding the presence of chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities; the distribution, morphology, density, location, and stage of abnormal shadows on chest CT; and observing the correlation between the severity of chest infection and lymphocyte ratio and blood oxygen saturation (SPO2) in patients. RESULTS: Chest CT revealed abnormal lung shadows in 110 patients. Regarding lesion distribution, multi-lobe lesions in both lungs were present in most patients (80 cases; 72.7%). Lesions most frequently involved both the peripheral zone and the central zone (62 cases; 56.4%). Regarding lesion morphology, 56 cases (50.1%) demonstrated patchy shadows that were partially fused into large areas. Thirty cases showed ground-glass opacity (27.3%), 30 cases showed the consolidation change (27.3%), and the remaining 50 cases showed both types of changes (45.4%). The progressing stage was the most common stage (54 cases; 49.1%). CT results showed a negative correlation with SPO2 and lymphocyte numbers (p<0.05), with r-values of -0.446 and -0.780, respectively. CONCLUSION: Spiral CT is a sensitive examination method, which can be applied to make an early diagnosis and for evaluation of progression, with a diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy better than that of nucleic acid detection.","Clin Radiol","Wang, K","Kang, S","Tian, R","Zhang, X","Zhang, X","Wang, Y","32216961"],"abstract":["AIM: To report the epidemiological, clinical, and radiological characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Xiaogan, Hubei, China.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data and CT images of 80 cases of NCP were collected. The clinical manifestations and laboratory test results of the patients were analysed. The lesions in each lung segment of the patient's chest CT images were characterised. Lesions were scored according to length and diffusivity. RESULTS: The main clinical manifestations were fever, dry cough, fatigue, a little white sputum, or diarrhoea. A total of 1,702 scored lesions were found in the first chest CT images of 80 patients. The lesions were located mainly in the subpleural area of the lungs (92.4%). Most of the lesions were ground-glass opacity, and subsequent fusions could increase in range and spread mainly in the subpleural area. Pulmonary consolidation accounted for 44.1% of all of the lesions. Of the 80 cases, 76 patients (95%) had bilateral lung disease, four (5%) patients had unilateral lung disease, and eight (10%) patients had cord shadow. CONCLUSION: The chest CT of NCP patients is characterised by the onset of bilateral ground-glass lesions located in the subpleural area of the lung, and progressive lesions that result in consolidation with no migratory lesions. Pleural effusions and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are rare. As patients can have inflammatory changes in the lungs alongside a negative early nucleic acid test, chest CT, in combination with epidemiological and laboratory tests, is a useful examination to evaluate the disease and curative effect.","Clin Radiol","Zhao, X","Liu, B","Yu, Y","Wang, X","Du, Y","Gu, J","Wu, X","32199619"],"abstract":["AIM: To investigate the characteristics and clinical value of chest computed tomography (CT) images of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).
