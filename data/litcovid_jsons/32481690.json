An attractive therapeutic target for CoVs is the M(pro) (main protease) or 3CL(pro) (3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease) as the enzyme plays a key role in the polyprotein processing and is active in a dimeric form.

Thus, drugs targeting M(pro) enzyme significantly reduce the risk of mutation-mediated drug resistance and display broad-spectrum antiviral activity.

In this regard, we compiled the literature reports highlighting the effect of mutations and N-terminal deletion of residues of SARS-CoV M(pro) on its dimerization and thus, catalytic activity.
