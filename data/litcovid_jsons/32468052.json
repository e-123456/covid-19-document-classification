The total genetic anomaly carrying rate of target genes, including ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147/BSG and FURIN/PCSK3, was determined as 8.1% and 21 mutations detected, with 7 of these mutations having pathogenic features. p.H34N on the RBD binding residues for SARS-CoV-2 was determined in our LUAD patient group.
