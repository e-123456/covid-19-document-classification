Resource reallocation will have consequences on the routine management of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). We consider how to mitigate potential adverse effects. RECENT FINDINGS: Combination therapy is well established in hypertension. Many guidelines recommend dual antihypertensive therapy as the initial treatment step as this results in faster blood pressure control, albeit with limited evidence of improved outcomes. Control of CVD risk factors through multiclass combination therapy (the polypill) was proposed many years ago. This approach has not been adopted by Western healthcare systems despite improving surrogate outcomes. Recently, the PolyIran trials have demonstrated improved CVD outcomes without increased adverse events, in both primary and secondary prevention. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic allows models of chronic healthcare to be rethought. Current practices are resource-intensive and there is a need to simplify titration and monitoring protocols in CVD. Moving toward the use of polypill combinations allied with telehealth consultations may be one solution.","Curr Opin Cardiol","Floyd, Christopher N","Wierzbicki, Anthony S","32398607"],"abstract":["PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced a redesign of healthcare services.
