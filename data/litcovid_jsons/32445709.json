METHODS: Collected samples of nasopharyngeal swabs from 2 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the First People's Hospital of Zhaoqing City, each of sample was divided into 5 groups (groupA approximately E): A:Non-inactivated raw sample; B:75% ethanol inactivation; C:56 incubation for 30 min inactivation; D:65 incubation for 10 min inactivation; E:Pre-inactivation using RNA virus special preservation fluid added into the sampling tube to treated the nasopharyngeal swab sample separately, using real-time fluorescent RT-PCR to detect the N gene of COVID-19 and the ORF1ab gene simultaneously. All the groups are diluted in 1:2, 1:4, 1:8 ratios. The objectives are to compare the effect of the varied inactivation method on CT(Cycle Threshold)results in PCR, conduct correlation and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: For the N gene and ORF1ab gene, the CT values of 4 inactivated and Non-inactivated treatment were correlated (P0.001). The results of the four treatment methods and specimens without inactivated treatment have shown good consistency. CONCLUSION: The treatment of nasopharyngeal swab specimens using mentioned four inactivated methods had no significant effect on the subsequent detection of the new COVID-19 nucleic acid test. Lab test-persons can flexibly adopt pre-inactivation methods to ensure the accuracy of virus nucleic acid test results, meanwhile guarantee the safety of lab test-persons.","Virus Res","Yueying, Wang","Song, Wei","Zhao, Zuguo","Chen, Ping","Liu, Jian","Li, Chende","32380210"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to explore the effect of four virus inactivation methods on the rapid detection results of COVID-19 nucleic acid.
