METHOD: The structure of community quarantine strategy was illustrated. Distribution of injuries among patients in two TCs between January 24, 2020 and February 24, 2020 was described. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the correlation between the distribution of Injuries in TCs and the number of COVID-19-associated cases. RESULTS: A total of 757 TC patients in the two hospitals were enrolled. The number of traffic injuries and outdoor injuries showed a significant decrease in the early stage and began to increase on February 17. The number of indoor injuries neither decreased nor increased. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between COVID-19-associated cases and traffic and outdoor injuries CONCLUSION: From the perspective of the injuries in TCs, community quarantine strategy was effectively implemented and significantly slowed the outbreak of COVID-19 in Anhui. However, the implementation and maintenance of the strategy is costly and requires the participation of the entire population.","Int J Infect Dis","Zhu, Wanbo","Li, Xinyuan","Wu, Yanning","Xu, Changqing","Li, Li","Yang, Jiazhao","Fang, Shiyuan","32283282"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to introduce community quarantine strategy against coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) in Anhui and evaluate the effectiveness of community quarantine based on trauma center (TC) patients.
