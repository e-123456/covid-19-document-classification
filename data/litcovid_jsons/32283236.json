Different drugs for prophylaxis against COVID-19 including chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been tried. This study was performed to systematically review the role of CQ and HCQ in preventing the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies that evaluated the prophylactic role of CQ or HCQ on SARS-CoV-2 (pre-clinical studies) or COVID-19 (clinical studies) until 30 March 2020. The available literature was critically appraised. RESULTS: A total of 45 articles were screened and five (three in vitro pre-clinical studies and two clinical opinions) were included. The pre-clinical studies showed the prophylactic effects of CQ and HCQ against SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, the clinical opinions advocated the prophylactic use of CQ and HCQ against COVID-19. However, no original clinical studies on the prophylactic role of CQ or HCQ on COVID-19 were available. CONCLUSION: Although pre-clinical results are promising, till date, there is dearth of evidence to support the efficacy of CQ or HCQ in preventing COVID-19. Considering potential safety issues and the likelihood of imparting a false sense of security, prophylaxis with CQ or HCQ against COVID-19 needs to be thoroughly evaluated in observational studies or high quality randomized controlled studies.","Int J Rheum Dis","Shah, Sanket","Das, Saibal","Jain, Avinash","Misra, Durga Prasanna","Negi, Vir Singh","32281213"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: The pandemic Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) has pushed the global healthcare system to a crisis and amounted to a huge economic burden.

We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. PATIENTS AND METHODS: French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16(th), to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. RESULTS: Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. CONCLUSION: Despite its small sample size our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.","Int J Antimicrob Agents","Gautret, Philippe","Lagier, Jean-Christophe","Parola, Philippe","Hoang, Van Thuan","Meddeb, Line","Mailhe, Morgane","Doudier, Barbara","Courjon, Johan","Giordanengo, Valerie","Vieira, Vera Esteves","Dupont, Herve Tissot","Honore, Stephane","Colson, Philippe","Chabriere, Eric","La Scola, Bernard","Rolain, Jean-Marc","Brouqui, Philippe","Raoult, Didier","32205204"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients.
