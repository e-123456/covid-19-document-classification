Neurological symptoms have been reported as part of the clinical spectrum of the disease. We aim to determine whether neurological manifestations are common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and to describe their main characteristics. METHODS: We systematically review all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to hospital in a Spanish population during March 2020. Demographic characteristics, systemic and neurological clinical manifestations, and complementary tests were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 841 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (mean age 66.4 years, 56.2% men) 57.4% developed some form of neurological symptom. Nonspecific symptoms such as myalgias (17.2%), headache (14.1%), and dizziness (6.1%) were present mostly in the early stages of infection. Anosmia (4.9%) and dysgeusia (6.2%) tended to occur early (60% as the first clinical manifestation) and were more frequent in less severe cases.
