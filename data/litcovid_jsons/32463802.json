Here we surveyed program directors (PDs) to ascertain how they have altered the education and clinical care responsibilities of residents in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Surveys were sent to the PDs of all ACGME-accredited neurosurgery programs. Survey questions targeted changes in resident staffing and coverage, changes in didactic material delivery, and changes in resident wellness initiatives. PD concerns were also elicited. RESULTS: Of the 116 program PDs invited, 57 responded (49.1%). We found that most programs have reduced resident work weeks (65%) and in-hospital resident shift census (95%). Few have redeployed residents and most are increasingly relying on teleconferencing solutions for meetings and resident education.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate OHNS residency program practice changes and characterize resident perceptions during the initial phase of the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of U.S. OHNS residents at 81 programs was conducted between March 23-29, 2020. RESULTS: 82 residents from 51 institutions (63% of invited programs) responded. At time of survey, 98% of programs had enacted policy changes to minimize COVID-19 spread. These included filtered respirator use for aerosol-generating procedures even in COVID-19-negative patients (85%), decreased resident staffing of surgeries (70%), and reduced frequency of tracheotomy care (61%). The majority of residents (66%) perceived that residents were at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to attendings. Residents were most concerned about protective equipment shortage (93%) and transmitting COVID-19 to patients (90%). The majority of residents (73%) were satisfied with their department's COVID-19 response.
