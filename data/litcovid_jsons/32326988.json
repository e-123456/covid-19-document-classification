OBJECTIVES: To identify the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with the severe incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All adult patients (>/=18 years old) consecutively admitted in Dabieshan Medical Center from January 30, 2020 to February 11, 2020 were collected and reviewed. Only patients diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance were included in this retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Twenty-five patients (23.1%, 25/108) developed severe disease, and of those 12 (48%, 12/25) patients died. Advanced age, co-morbidities with hypertension, higher blood leukocyte count, neutrophil count, higher sensitive C-reactive protein level, D-dimer level, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APECHE ) score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were associated with greater risk of development of severe COVID-19, and so were lower lymphocyte count and albumin level.
