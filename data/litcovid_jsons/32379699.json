In patients with clinical insufficiency showing clinical deterioration during an acute COVID-19 infection, we advise immediate (self-)injection of 100mg hydrocortisone intramuscularly, followed by continuous intravenous infusion of 200mg hydrocortisone per 24 hours, or until this can be established, administration of 50mg hydrocortisone every 6 hours.","Eur J Endocrinol","Arlt, Wiebke","Baldeweg, Stephanie E","Pearce, Simon H S","Simpson, Helen L","32379699"],"abstract":["We provide guidance on prevention of adrenal crisis during the global COVID-19 crisis, which exposes patients with adrenal insufficiency to an increased risk of acute COVID-19 infection while at the same time restricting access to healthcare due to capacity issues.
