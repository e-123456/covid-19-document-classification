Experiential apprentice-style training is traditionally recognised as an important aspect of obtaining competency. In March 2020 they were stood down from their general practice placements in the context of a national response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Acute conversion of their general practice education from experiential clinical exposure to online and offsite learning was required. This paper describes the steps taken and the underlying theoretical foundations for our expediently developed online course. Our online learning programme has three online components, reflecting the domains of educational environment theory: asynchronous discussion forums; a symposium facilitating social interactions and teacher presence, and a portfolio facilitating personal goal aspects. The latter is underpinned by a multi-theories model of adult learning, built upon the scaffolding framework that supports our entire medical curriculum. Within this theory, we propose a five-stage model of learning. Learning from this experience contributes to the body of knowledge around online education, particularly in meeting the needs of a clinical attachment traditionally grounded in experiential learning. It is hoped that the mechanisms described here might be useful to other educators facing similar challenges.","Educ Prim Care","Roskvist, Rachel","Eggleton, Kyle","Goodyear-Smith, Felicity","32469632"],"abstract":["Senior medical students at the University of Auckland, New Zealand spend most of their learning time in clinical attachments.
