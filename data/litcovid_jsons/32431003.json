METHODS: We modified workflows, deployed home workstations, and changed staffing models with the goal of providing additional clinical support to bedside colleagues while reducing exposure time and conserving personal protective equipment for those caring for this highly contagious patient population. The unit changed focus and granted more than 300 clinicians access to technology that enabled them to care for patients remotely, added nearly 200 mobile carts, and allowed more than 20 tele-intensive care unit nurses to work from home. RESULTS: Tele-intensive care unit nursing provided clinical knowledge to the nurses covering current and expanded critical care units. Using technology, virtual rounding, and increased collaboration with nurses, tele-intensive care unit nursing minimized the risk to bedside nurses while maintaining a high level of care for patients. CONCLUSION: Tele-intensive care unit nurses provided a proactive, holistic approach to caring for critically ill patients via camera as part of their routine workflow.

DESIGN: A descriptive, secondary analysis of data collected as part of the final wave of the Work, Family and Health Study. SETTING: Thirty nursing home facilities located throughout the northeastern United States. PARTICIPANTS: A subset of 958 essential, facility-based LTC workers involved in direct patient care. MEASUREMENTS: We present information on LTC workers' demographic characteristics, health, features of their LTC occupation, additional paid work, wages, and double- or triple-duty caregiving roles. RESULTS: The majority of LTC workers were certified nursing assistants, followed by licensed practical nurses and registered nurses. Overall, over 70% of these workers agreed or strongly agreed with the following statement: \"When you are sick, you still feel obligated to come into work.\" One-sixth had a second job, where they worked an average of 20 hours per week, and over 60% held double- or triple-duty caregiving roles. Additional paid work and unpaid care work characteristics did not significantly differ by occupational group, although the prevalence of second jobs was highest and accompanying work hours were longest among certified nursing assistants. CONCLUSION: LTC workers commonly hold second jobs along with double- and triple-duty caregiving roles.

Objective: To analyse the actual work hours and preferred work hours per shift of nurses reports among frontline nurses fighting the COVID-19 epidemic and to explore the influencing factors on the nurses reported preferred work hours. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Settings: This study was conducted in 10 designated hospitals providing treatments to patients with COVID-19 in China. Participants: Nurses providing care to patients with COVID-19 in designated hospitals in China. Methods: A self-designed questionnaire with open-ended questions was used to assess frontline nurses caring for COVID-19 cases in 10 designated hospitals. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyse the actual work hours, the nurses reported preferred work hours and factors influencing nurses reported preferred work hours among the frontline nurses.
