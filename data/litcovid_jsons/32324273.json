However, out-of-hospital professionals cannot access patient information, which has greatly reduced the efficiency of treatment; it is inconvenient for health care professionals to issue a case discussion with professionals from other wards. This article mainly introduces a mobile telehealth system (MTS) applied to facilitate patient information presentation and case discussion. Materials and Methods: The MTS searches patient information, which is stored in hospital intranet, and uses five modules to display patient information. By a request/response module and a real-time interaction module, we successfully conducted case discussions. In addition, we took measures in three areas to prevent patient information leakage. Results: The system uses mobile collaboration technology to present patient information and support case discussion.
