Patients in the death group exhibited significantly lower lymphocyte count (0.63 [0.40, 0.79] x 10/L vs. 1.00 [0.72, 1.27] x 10/L, Z = 8.037, P < 0.001) and lymphocyte/WBC ratio (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs. 23.5 [15.27, 31.25]%, Z = 10.315, P < 0.001) on admission, and the lymphocyte/WBC ratio continue to decrease during hospitalization (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs. 2.91 [1.79, 6.13]%, Z = 5.242, P < 0.001). Alanine transaminase (ALT) (22.00 [15.00, 34.00] U/L vs. 18.70 [13.00, 30.38] U/L, Z = 2.592, P = 0.010), aspartate transaminase (AST) (34.00 [27.00, 47.00] U/L vs. 22.00 [17.65, 31.75] U/L, Z = 7.308, P < 0.001), and creatinine levels (89.00 [72.00, 133.50] mumol/L vs.65.00 [54.60, 78.75] mumol/L, Z = 6.478, P < 0.001) were significantly higher in the death group that those in the recovered group. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also significantly higher in the death group on admission (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] mg/L vs.3.22 [1.04, 21.80] mg/L, Z = 10.206, P < 0.001) showed no significant improvement after treatment (109.25 [35.0, 170.28] mg/L vs. 81.60 [27.23, 179.08] mg/L, Z = 1.219, P = 0.233). The patients in the death group had more complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (89.9% vs. 7.6%, chi = 148.105, P < 0.001), acute cardiac injury (59.6% vs. 0.8%, chi = 93.222, P < 0.001), acute kidney injury (18.3% vs. 0, chi = 23.257, P < 0.001), shock (11.9% vs. 0, chi = 14.618, P < 0.001), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (6.4% vs. 0, chi = 7.655, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the recovered group, more patients in the death group exhibited characteristics of advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities, dyspnea, oxygen saturation decrease, increased WBC count, decreased lymphocytes, and elevated CRP levels. More patients in the death groups had complications such as ARDS, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, shock, and DIC."],"journal":"Chin Med J (Engl)","authors":["Deng, Yan","Liu, Wei","Liu, Kui","Fang, Yuan-Yuan","Shang, Jin","Zhou, Ling","Wang, Ke","Leng, Fan","Wei, Shuang","Chen, Lei","Liu, Hui-Guo"],"date":"2020-03-27T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32209890","week":"202013|Mar 23 - Mar 29","doi":"10.1097/CM9.0000000000000824","source":"PubMed","locations":["China","Wuhan"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1663095625831415808,"score":228.36496},{"pmid":32193831,"title":"Clinical features of severe pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan: a single center's observational study.","text":["Clinical features of severe pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan: a single center's observational study.","BACKGROUND: An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei, China. People of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No information on severe pediatric patients with COVID-19 has been reported. We aimed to describe the clinical features of severe pediatric patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We included eight severe or critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Wuhan Children's Hospital from January 24 to February 24. We collected information including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of the patients with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: The onset age of the eight patients ranged from 2 months to 15 years; six were boys. The most common symptoms were polypnea (8/8), followed by fever (6/8) and cough (6/8). Chest imaging showed multiple patch-like shadows in seven patients and ground-glass opacity in six. Laboratory findings revealed normal or increased whole blood counts (7/8), increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase (6/8), and abnormal liver function (4/8). Other findings included decreased CD16 + CD56 (4/8) and Th/Ts*(1/8), increased CD3 (2/8), CD4 (4/8) and CD8 (1/8), IL-6 (2/8), IL-10 (5/8) and IFN-gamma (2/8). Treatment modalities were focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Two critically ill patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation.
