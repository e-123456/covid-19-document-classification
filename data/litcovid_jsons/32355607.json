They are concerned about their risk of developing COVID-19 as many are immune suppressed from their disease and/or treatment, whether they should stop their advanced therapies, if they will have a worse outcome if/when infected due to their underlying medication condition(s) and if they will have drug availability, especially with press (without much data) coverage suggesting hydroxychloroquine may be used in COVID-19 infection causing diversion of medication supply. This article discusses how the pandemic affects people with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Recent findings: Preliminarily, articles seem to suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases may not have more infections from SARS-CoV-2 and similar outcomes to age and gender matched patients, but fear of rheumatic medications increasing their risk, drug shortages, and work exposure all are concerns for patients. Recent findings: The long term effects of the pandemic in patients with rheumatic diseases will not be known until much later and likely include stressors flaring disease (fear, illness, job loss, social isolation), post-traumatic stress, flaring due to stopping medications, less physician visits with subsequent under-treatment, and increases in chronic concomitant fatigue, pain, fibromyalgia.","Curr Treatm Opt Rheumatol","Pope, Janet E","32355607"],"abstract":["Purpose of review: The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in uncertainty for patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases for several reasons.

METHODS: This is a retrospective case series study. Deidentified data, including gender, age, laboratory and radiological results, symptoms, signs, and medication history, were collected from 2326 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including 21 cases in combination with rheumatic disease, in Tongji Hospital between 13 January and 15 March 2020. RESULTS: Length of hospital stay and mortality rate were similar between rheumatic and non-rheumatic groups, while the presence of respiratory failure was more common in rheumatic cases (38% vs 10%, p<0.001).

METHODS: Participants in a US-wide longitudinal observational registry responded to a supplemental COVID-19 questionnaire by email on March 25, 2020 about their symptoms, COVID-19 testing, healthcare changes, and related experiences during the prior two weeks. Analysis compared responses by diagnosis, disease activity, and new onset of symptoms. Qualitative analysis was conducted on optional free-text comment fields. RESULTS: Of the 7,061 participants invited, 530 responded, with RA the most frequent diagnosis (61%). Eleven met COVID-19 screening criteria, of which two sought testing unsuccessfully. Six others sought testing, three were successful, and all were negative. Not quite half (42%) reported a change to their care in the prior two weeks. Qualitative analysis revealed four key themes: emotions in response to the pandemic, perceptions of risks from immunosuppressive medications, protective measures to reduce risk of COVID-19 infection, and disruptions in accessing rheumatic disease medications including hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSION: After two weeks, many with rheumatic diseases already had important changes to their healthcare, with many altering medications without professional consultation or due to hydroxychloroquine shortage.
