Here we review relevant research evidence, and provide evidence-based recommendations and resources for hospital clinicians to mitigate poor bereavement outcomes and support staff. For relatives, bereavement risk factors include dying in an intensive care unit, severe breathlessness, patient isolation or restricted access, significant patient and family emotional distress, and disruption to relatives' social support networks. Recommendations include advance care planning; proactive, sensitive and regular communication with family members alongside accurate information provision; enabling family members to say goodbye in person where possible; supporting virtual communication; providing excellent symptom management and emotional and spiritual support; and providing and/or sign-posting to bereavement services. To mitigate effects of this emotionally challenging work on staff, we recommend an organisational and systemic approach which includes access to informal and professional support.","J Pain Symptom Manage","Selman, Lucy E","Chao, Davina","Sowden, Ryann","Marshall, Steve","Chamberlain, Charlotte","Koffman, Jonathan","32376262"],"abstract":["Deaths due to COVID-19 are associated with risk factors which can lead to prolonged grief disorder, post-traumatic stress and other poor bereavement outcomes among relatives, as well as moral injury and distress in frontline staff.
