Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially characterized in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published to date. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). RESULTS: 660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020). After screening, 27 articles were selected for full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Additionally, 39 case report articles were included and analyzed separately. For 656 patients, fever (88.7%, 95%CI 84.5-92.9%), cough (57.6%, 40.8-74.4%) and dyspnea (45.6%, 10.9-80.4%) were the most prevalent manifestations. Among the patients, 20.3% (95%CI 10.0-30.6%) required intensive care unit (ICU), 32.8% presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (95%CI 13.7-51.8), 6.2% (95%CI 3.1-9.3) with shock. Some 13.9% (95%CI 6.2-21.5%) of hospitalized patients had fatal outcomes (case fatality rate, CFR). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 brings a huge burden to healthcare facilities, especially in patients with comorbidities. ICU was required for approximately 20% of polymorbid, COVID-19 infected patients and hospitalization was associated with a CFR of over 13%. As this virus spreads globally, countries need to urgently prepare human resources, infrastructure and facilities to treat severe COVID-19.","Travel Med Infect Dis","Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J","Cardona-Ospina, Jaime A","Gutierrez-Ocampo, Estefania","Villamizar-Pena, Rhuvi","Holguin-Rivera, Yeimer","Escalera-Antezana, Juan Pablo","Alvarado-Arnez, Lucia Elena","Bonilla-Aldana, D Katterine","Franco-Paredes, Carlos","Henao-Martinez, Andres F","Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto","Lagos-Grisales, Guillermo J","Ramirez-Vallejo, Eduardo","Suarez, Jose A","Zambrano, Lysien I","Villamil-Gomez, Wilmer E","Balbin-Ramon, Graciela J","Rabaan, Ali A","Harapan, Harapan","Dhama, Kuldeep","Nishiura, Hiroshi","Kataoka, Hiromitsu","Ahmad, Tauseef","Sah, Ranjit","32179124"],"abstract":["INTRODUCTION: An epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December 2019 in China leading to a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).
