We aim to provide a comprehensive guide on how to rapidly integrate telemedicine into practice during a pandemic.

RESULTS: Rapid integration of telemedicine in our practice was required to be compliant with our institution's COVID-19 Taskforce. Within 3 days of this declaration, our large specialty-care clinic converted to a telemedicine platform and we completed 638 visits within the first month of implementation.
