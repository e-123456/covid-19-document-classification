The objective of this review is to explore links between biodiversity on all scales and allergic disease as a measure of immune dysregulation. DATA SOURCES: Were identified from PubMed and Web of Science using search terms pertaining to biodiversity, nature-relatedness, allergic disease, microbiome, NCDs, COVID-19 and associated terms. STUDY SELECTIONS: Studies were selected based on relevance to human health and biodiversity. RESULTS: Contact with natural environments enriches the human microbiome, promotes regulated immune responses, and protects from allergy and both acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. These important links to eco-psychological constructs of the 'extinction of experience' which indicates that loss of direct, personal contact with biodiversity-wildlife and the more visible elements of the natural world-might lead to emotional apathy and irresponsible behaviors toward the environment. CONCLUSION: The immune system is a useful early barometer of environmental impacts, and via the microbiome, a measure of the way in which our current experiences differ from our ancestral past.
