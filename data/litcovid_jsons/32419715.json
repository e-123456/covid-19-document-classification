All nations are seriously challenged as the virus spreads rapidly across the globe with no regard for borders. The primary management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves treating uncontrolled inflammation with most patients requiring immune based therapies.

AIM: To summarise the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, review unique concerns regarding IBD management and infection risk during the pandemic and assess COVID-19 management options and drug interactions in the IBD population. METHODS: A literature review on IBD, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 was undertaken and relevant literature was summarized and critically examined. RESULTS: IBD patients do not appear to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and there is no evidence of an association between IBD therapies and increased risk of COVID-19. IBD medication adherence should be encouraged to prevent disease flare but where possible high dose systemic corticosteroids should be avoided. Patients should exercise social distancing, optimise co-morbidities and be up to date with influenza and pneumococcal vaccine. If a patient develops COVID-19, immune suppressing medications should be withheld until infection resolution and if trial medications for COVID-19 are being considered, potential drug interactions should be checked.
