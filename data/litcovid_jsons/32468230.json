Many patients with psoriasis on biologic therapy have asked their medical providers about the effect of biologics on COVID-19. However, it is currently unknown how biologic therapy for psoriasis might impact patients with psoriasis and COVID-19. In this article, we report on the clinical course of two patients on biologic medication for psoriasis who developed COVID-19 and successfully recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both patients presented with fever and respiratory symptoms, but neither patient required hospitalization. While more research is needed, it is reassuring to know that successful recovery is possible after COVID-19 infection in patients on biologic therapy for psoriasis.","Dermatol Ther (Heidelb)","Brownstone, Nicholas D","Thibodeaux, Quinn G","Reddy, Vidhatha D","Myers, Bridget A","Chan, Stephanie Y","Bhutani, Tina","Liao, Wilson","32468230"],"abstract":["The outbreak of the novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) causing COVID-19 was first reported in late December 2019.

This commentary offers patient counseling recommendations based on the current available evidence. While there are currently no specific data for psoriasis biologics and COVID-19, data are presented here from phase III clinical trials of psoriasis biologics on rates of upper respiratory infection, influenza, and serious infection. Overall these data reveal that on the whole, psoriasis biologics do not show major increases in infection risk compared to placebo during the course of these trials. However, as the COVID-19 virus is a novel pathogen that is associated with mortality in a subset of patients, a cautious approach is warranted. We discuss factors that may alter the benefit-risk ratio of biologic use during this time of COVID-19 outbreak. Ultimately, treatment decisions should be made on the basis of dialogue between patient and provider, considering each patient's individualized situation.

In this review, we discuss overall infection risks of non-biologic and biologic systemic medications for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and provide therapeutic recommendations. In summary, in patients with active infection, systemic conventional medications, the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib, and biologics for psoriasis should be temporarily held until there is more data; in uninfected patients switching to safer alternatives should be considered. Interleukin (IL)-17, IL-12/23 and IL-23 inhibitors are associated with low infection risk, with IL-17 and IL-23 favored over IL-12/23 inhibitors. Pivotal trials and postmarketing data also suggest that IL-17 and IL-23 blockers are safer than TNF-blockers. Apremilast, acitretin and dupilumab, have favorable safety data, and may be safely initiated and continued in uninfected patients.
