RESULTS: All the 48 public tertiary dental hospitals suspended general non-emergency dental treatment while providing emergency dental services only. Ninety percent of them notified the change of dental services online, and 69% of them offered free online professional consultations. The penetration rate of online technology was significantly higher in the eastern region than that of the central and western regions.
