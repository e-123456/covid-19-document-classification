METHODS: Specificity was evaluated in 103 samples collected before January 2020. Sensitivity and time to seropositivity was evaluated in samples from 94 patients with COVID-19 confirmed with PCR on nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: Specificity [confidence interval] of lateral flow assays (LFA) was >/= 91.3% [84.0-95.5] for IgM, >/= 90.3% [82.9-94.8] for IgG, and >/= 85.4% [77.2-91.1] for the combination IgM OR IgG.

Positivity of IgM OR IgG for LFA resulted in a decrease in specificity compared to IgG alone without a gain in diagnostic performance except for VivaDiag. The results for IgM varied significantly between the LFA with an average overall agreement of only 70% compared to 89% for IgG. The average dynamic trend to seropositivity for IgM was not shorter than for IgG. At time of admission to the hospital, the sensitivity of LFA was <60%. CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity for the detection IgG antibodies 14-25 days after onset of symptoms was >/= 92.1% for all 7 LFA compared to 89.5% for the IgG ELISA.
