Although chest Computer Tomography (CT) represents the gold standard to assess lung involvement, with a specificity even superior to the nasal/pharyngeal swab for diagnosis, lung ultrasound examination can be a valid alternative to CT scan, with some advantages, particularly desirable for pregnant women. Indeed, ultrasound can be performed directly at bed side by a single operator, reducing the risk of spreading the outbreak among health professionals, as well as it is a radiation free exam making to be easier monitoring those patients who require serial exams. In the present study, we reported four cases of pregnant women affectd by COVID-19 infection who have been monitoring with lung ultrasound examination. All patients showed ultrasound features indicative of COVID-19 pneumonia at admission: irregular pleural lines and vertical artifacts (B-lines) were observed in all four cases, whereas patchy areas of white lung in two cases. LUS was more sensitive than chest X-ray in detecting COVID-19. Three patients had resolution of lung pathology at ultrasound after 96 h of admission. Two pregnancies are ongoing, whereas two patients had cesarean delivery with no fetal complications. PCR testing of both cord blood and newborn swabs were negative in both cases.
