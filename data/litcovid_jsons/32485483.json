However, atypical presentations of this disease have been evolving since the initial outbreak of the pandemic in December 2019. OBJECTIVE: Here, we report a case of an older male patient who presented at our hospital with an unusual manifestation of COVID-19. DESIGN: Brief report. SETTING: A university hospital in Saudi Arabia. PARTICIPANT: A 73-year-old man who presented with confusion in the absence of any respiratory symptoms or fever. INTERVENTION: He was initially admitted with delirium and was subjected to a further work-up. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Given his recent history of domestic travel and the declaration of a global COVID-19 pandemic status, he was subjected to a swab test for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The patient's positive test led to a diagnosis of COVID-19. Although he began to experience a spiking fever and mild upper respiratory symptoms, he recovered rapidly with no residual sequela.
