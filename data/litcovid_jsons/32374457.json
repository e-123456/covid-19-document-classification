Coronaviruses enter cells via fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane and/or via fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes after virion endocytosis. The Spike (S) glycoprotein is a major determinant of virus infectivity. Herein, we show that transient expression of the SARS CoV-2 S glycoprotein in Vero cells caused extensive cell fusion (formation of syncytia) in comparison to limited cell fusion caused by the SARS CoV S glycoprotein. Both S glycoproteins were detected intracellularly and on transfected Vero cell surfaces. These results are in agreement with published pathology observations of extensive syncytial formation in lung tissues of COVID-19 patients. These results suggest that SARS CoV-2 is able to spread from cell-to-cell much more efficiently than SARS-CoV effectively avoiding extracellular neutralizing antibodies. A systematic screening of several drugs including cardiac glycosides and kinase inhibitors and inhibitors of HIV entry revealed that only the FDA approved HIV-protease inhibitor, nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) drastically inhibited Sn and So-mediated cell fusion with complete inhibition at a 10 muM concentration. In silico docking experiments suggested the possibility that nelfinavir may bind inside the S trimer structure, proximal to the S2 amino terminus directly inhibiting Sn and So-mediated membrane fusion. Also, it is possible that nelfinavir may act to inhibit S proteolytic processing within cells. These results warrant further investigations of the potential of nelfinavir mesylate to inhibit virus spread at early times after SARS CoV-2 symptoms appear. This article is protected by copyright.
