METHODS: Our article comprehensively searched PubMed, FMRS, EMbase, CNKI,WanFang databases and VIP databases to collect literatures about the CT imaging features of COVID-19 from 1 January 2020 to 16 March 2020. Three reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies, and then, this meta-analysis was performed by using Stata12.0 software. RESULTS: 34 retrospective studies involving a total of 4 121 COVID-19 patients were included. The results of meta-analysis showed that most patients presented bilateral lung involvement (73.8%, 95%CI: 65.9%-81.1%) or multilobar involvement (67.3%,95%CI: 54.8%-78.7 %) and just a little patients showed normal CT findings (8.4%). We found that the most common changes in lesion density was ground-glass opacities (68.1%,95%CI: 56.9%-78.2%).
