MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created a patient portal-based COVID-19 self-triage and self-scheduling tool and made it available to all primary care patients at this large academic health system. Asymptomatic patients were asked about exposure history and were then provided relevant information. Symptomatic patients were triaged into one of four categories-emergent, urgent, non-urgent or self-care- and then connected with the appropriate level of care via direct scheduling or telephone hotline. RESULTS: This self-triage and self-scheduling tool was designed and implemented in under two weeks. During the first 16 days of use, it was completed 1129 times by 950 unique patients. Of completed sessions, 315 (28%) were by asymptomatic patients, and 814 (72%) were by symptomatic patients. Symptomatic patient triage dispositions were as follows: 193 emergent (24%), 193 urgent (24%), 99 nonurgent (12%), 329 self-care (40%). Sensitivity for detecting emergency-level care was 87.5% (95% CI 61.7-98.5%). DISCUSSION: This self-triage and self-scheduling tool has been widely used by patients and is being rapidly expanded to other populations and health systems. The tool has recommended emergency-level care with high sensitivity, and decreased triage time for patients with less severe illness. The data suggests it also prevents unnecessary triage messages, phone calls and in-person visits. CONCLUSION: Patient self-triage tools integrated into electronic health record systems have the potential to greatly improve triage efficiency and prevent unnecessary visits during the COVID-19 pandemic.","J Am Med Inform Assoc","Judson, Timothy J","Odisho, Anobel Y","Neinstein, Aaron B","Chao, Jessica","Williams, Aimee","Miller, Christopher","Moriarty, Tim","Gleason, Nathaniel","Intinarelli, Gina","Gonzales, Ralph","32267928"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To rapidly deploy a digital patient-facing self-triage and self-scheduling tool in a large academic health system to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
