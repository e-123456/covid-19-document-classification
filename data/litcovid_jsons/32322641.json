METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from 26th to 28th of February, 2020. Participants were Iranian medical students (5th-7th year) whose knowledge, preventive behaviors and risk perceptions of COVID-19 were assessed using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 26 questions including 15 items about COVID-19 related knowledge, 9 items regarding preventive measures and 2 items about COVID-19 risk perception. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire were shown to be satisfactory. RESULTS: A total of 240 medical students completed the questionnaire. The mean age of participants was 23.67 years.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables at the significance level of p<0.05. RESULTS: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% were males, 32.1% were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (30.2%) and medical students (29.6%).

In addition, individuals were encouraged to adopt personal health measures, such as social isolation. Information regarding the disease and measures were distributed through a variety of channels including social media, news websites and emails. Previous research suggests that the vast amount of available information can be confusing, potentially resulting in over-concern and information overload. OBJECTIVE: We investigate the impact of online information on individual-level intention to voluntarily self-isolate during the pandemic. Using the protection-motivation theory as a framework, we propose a model outlining the effect of cyberchondria and information overload on individuals' perceptions and motivation. METHODS: To test the proposed model, we collected data with an online survey (N=225) and analysed it using partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The effects of social media and living situation were tested through multi-group analysis (PLS-MGA). RESULTS: Cyberchondria and information overload had a significant impact on individuals' threat and coping perceptions, and through them on self-isolation intention. Among the appraisal constructs, perceived severity (P=0.002) and self-efficacy (P=0.003) positively impacted self-isolation intention while response cost (P<0.001) affected the intention negatively. Cyberchondria (P=0.003) and information overload (P=0.003) indirectly affected self-isolation intention through the aforementioned perceptions. Using social media as an information source increased both cyberchondria and information overload. No difference in perceptions was found between people living alone and those living with their families. (P>0.05).
