METHODS: The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status.

AIMS: To assess the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on the sleep quality of healthcare workers in a children's healthcare centre in Wuhan. METHODS: A cross-sectional, anonymized, self-reported questionnaire survey was conducted at the Children's Healthcare Centre of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. The questionnaire consisted of three parts, including socio-demographic characteristics and COVID-19 epidemic-related factors, the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), and Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS). RESULTS: In total, 47 out of 123 (38%) participants with PSQI scores > 7 were identified as having sleep disturbance.
