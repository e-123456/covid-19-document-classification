The disease epidemic is caused by a novel coronavirus, called COVID-19, which has now infected more than 700,000 people worldwide.

Objective: To systematically review and evaluate the pattern of COVID-19 and the treatment plans. Methods: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The articles were searched from databases like PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, and the Health Research and Development Information Network (HERDIN) combining MeSH and free-text terms. Results: This analysis highlights the agent of COVID-19 and the possible transmission.

Conclusion: Herein, we present an epidemiological overview of the currently available information on the treatment claimed to have helped to bring the situation under control.","Z Gesundh Wiss","T K, Sivabakya","G, Srinivas","32351873"],"abstract":["Background: China has been fighting the epidemic of pneumonia-like diseases first detected for over a month in the city of Wuhan in December 2019.
