Available guidelines recommend to reorganize transplant care but data on clinical experience in the context of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are scarce. Thus, we report strategies and preliminary results in liver transplantation during the peak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic from a single-center in France. Our strategy to reorganize the transplant program included four main steps: optimization of available resources especially intensive care unit capacity, multidisciplinary risk stratification of liver transplantation candidates on the waiting list, implementation of a systematic SARS-CoV-2 screening strategy prior to transplantation and definition of optimal recipient-donor matching. After implementation of these four steps, we performed 10 successful liver transplantations during the peak of the pandemic with a short median intensive care unit stay (2,5 days), benchmark post-transplant morbidity and no occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during follow-up. From this preliminary experience we conclude that efforts in resource planning, optimal recipient selection and organ allocation strategy are key to maintain a safe liver transplant activity. Transplant centers should be ready to readapt their practices as the pandemic evolves.","Am J Transplant","Muller, Xavier","Tilmans, Gilles","Chenevas-Paule, Quentin","Lebosse, Fanny","Antonini, Teresa","Poinsot, Domitille","Rode, Agnes","Guichon, Celine M","Schmitt, Zoe","Ducerf, Christian","Mohkam, Kayvan","Lesurtel, Mickael","Mabrut, Jean-Yves","32476233"],"abstract":["Liver transplantation during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is challenging given the urgent need to reallocate resources to other areas of patient care.

METHODS: We performed an international multi-center study of transplant centers to understand the evolution of policies for transplant prioritization in response to the pandemic in March 2020.

RESULTS: Seventeen large- and medium- sized liver transplant centers from twelve countries across four continents participated. Ten centers opted to limit transplant activity in response to the pandemic, favoring a \"sickest-first\" approach.

To model these and other ethical tensions, we computed a QE score using 4 factors - Recipient Outcome, Donor/Graft Safety, Waiting List Mortality and Healthcare Resources for seven countries. The fluctuation of the QE score over time accurately reflects the dynamic changes in the ethical tensions surrounding transplant activity in a pandemic.
