The aim of this study was to look for the warning index in severe COVID-19 patients. We investigated forty-three adult patients with COVID-19. The patients were classified into mild group (28 patients) and severe group (15 patients). Comparison of the haematological parameters between the mild and severe groups showed significant differences in IL-6, D-Dimer, GLU, TT, FIB and CRP (P <0.05). The optimal threshold and area under the ROC curve of IL-6 were 24.3 pg/mL and 0.795 respectively, while those of D-Dimer were 0.28 microg/L and 0.750, respectively. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of IL-6 combined with D-Dimer was 0.840. The specificity of predicting the severity of COVID-19 during IL-6 and D-Dimer tandem testing was up to 93.3%, while the sensitivity of IL-6 and D-Dimer by parallel test in the severe COVID-19 was 96.4%. IL-6 and D-Dimer were closely related to the occurrence of severe COVID-19 in the adult patients, and their combined detection had the highest specificity and sensitivity for early prediction of the severity of COVID-19 patients, which has important clinical value.

In poultry, the genetic diversity, evolution, distribution, and taxonomy of CoVs dominant in birds other than chickens remain enigmatic. In our previous study, we proposed that the CoVs dominant (i.e., mainly circulating) in ducks (DdCoVs) should represent a novel species, which was different from the one represented by the CoVs dominant in chickens (CdCoVs). In this study, we conducted a large-scale surveillance of CoVs in chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons and other birds (quails, sparrows and partridges) using a conserved RT-PCR assay. The surveillance demonstrated that CdCoVs, DdCoVs and the CoVs dominant in pigeons (PdCoVs) belong to different lineages, and they are all prevalent in live poultry markets and the backyard flocks in some regions of China. We further sequenced seven Coronaviridae-wide conserved domains in their replicase polyprotein pp1ab of seven PdCoVs, and found that the genetic distances in these domains between PdCoVs and DdCoVs or CdCoVs are large enough to separate PdCoVs into a novel species, which were different from the ones represented by DdCoVs or CdCoVs within the genus Gammacoronavirus, per the species demarcation criterion of International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.
