Methods: From January 20 to February 5, 2020, a total of 130 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from seven hospitals in China were collected. The imaging data were reviewed and analyzed in detail. Results: (1) Distribution: the lesion detected in the lung unilaterally in 14 cases (10.7%) and bilaterally in 116 cases (89.3%). According to the distribution in the lobes of the lung, all cases could be classified into subpleural distribution (102 cases, 78.4%), centrilobular distribution (99 cases, 76.1%) and diffused distribution (8 cases, 6.1%). (2) Number of lesions: single lesion 9 cases (6.9%); multiple lesions 113 cases (86.9%), diffuse lesions 8 cases (6.1%). (3) Imaging density: 70 cases (53.8%) of ground-glass opacity (GGO), 60 cases (46.2%) of GGO + consolidation. (4) Accompanying signs: 100 cases (76.9%) with vascular thickening, 98 cases (75.3%) with \"pleural parallel sign\" ; \"intralobular septal thickening\" in 100 cases (76.9%); \"halo sign\" in 13 cases (10%); \"reversed-halo sign\" in 6 cases (4.6%); pleural effusion in 3 cases (2.3 %), and pneumatocele in 2 cases (1.5%); no case with pulmonary cavity. Among 35 patients that underwent follow-up CT, 21 patients (60%) improved while 14 (40%) exacerbated.
