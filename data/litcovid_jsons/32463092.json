SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is typically minimally symptomatic. We report a series of febrile pediatric patients with acute heart failure potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control. Methods: Over a two-month period contemporary with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France and Switzerland, we retrospectively collected clinical, biological, therapeutic, and early outcomes data in children who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in 14 centers for cardiogenic shock, left ventricular dysfunction and severe inflammatory state. Results: Thirty-five children were identified and included in the study. Median age at admission was 10 years (range 2-16 years). Co-morbidities were present in 28% including asthma and overweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms were prominent. Left ventricular ejection fraction was <30% in one third; 80% required inotropic support with 28% treated with ECMO.
