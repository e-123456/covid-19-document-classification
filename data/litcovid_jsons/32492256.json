We analysed the impact of the pandemic on these patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms and their quality of life after five weeks of lockdown in Spain. METHODS: We tested 40 subjects with a diagnosis of MCI (20) or mild AD (20) from the Cognitive Stimulation Program of Cognitive Disorders Unit. All patients had undergone a previous evaluation during the month before the lockdown, and they were re-evaluated after 5 weeks of lockdown. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and EuroQol-5D were used to evaluate the neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life of patients and caregivers. RESULTS: The total baseline NPI score was 33.75 (22.28) vs 39.05 (27.96) after confinement (p=0.028). The most frequent neuropsychiatric symptoms affected were apathy (4.15 (3.78) vs 5.75 (4.02); p=0.002) and anxiety (3.95 (3.73) vs 5.30 (4.01); p=0.006) in MCI patients and apathy (2.35 (2.70) vs 3.75 (3.78); p=0.036), agitation (0.45 (1.14) vs 1.50 (2.66); p=0.029) and aberrant motor behaviour (1.25 (2.86) vs 2.00 (2.93); p=0.044) in AD patients.
