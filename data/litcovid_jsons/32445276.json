Thoracic ultrasound showed signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia and the Sars-Cov-2 swab was positive. Antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin treatment were initiated. Due to the progressive impairment of respiratory function, the patient was intubated after eight days from the admission. The day after he showed signs of bilateral acute limb ischemia.
