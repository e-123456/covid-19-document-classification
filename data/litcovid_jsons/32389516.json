This unexpected and dramatic situation could increase the incidence of mental health problems, among them, psychotic disorders. The aim of this paper was to describe a case series of brief reactive psychosis due to the psychological distress from the current coronavirus pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report on a case series including all the patients with reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID-19 crisis who were admitted to the Virgen del Rocio and Virgen Macarena University Hospitals (Seville, Spain) during the first two weeks of compulsory nationwide quarantine. RESULTS: In that short period, four patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for a brief reactive psychotic disorder. All of the episodes were directly triggered by stress derived from the COVID-19 pandemic and half of the patients presented severe suicidal behavior at admission. CONCLUSIONS: We may now be witnessing an increasing number of brief reactive psychotic disorders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This type of psychosis has a high risk of suicidal behavior and, although short-lived, has a high rate of psychotic recurrence and low diagnostic stability over time. Therefore, we advocate close monitoring in both the acute phase and long-term follow-up of these patients.","Rev Psiquiatr Salud Ment","Valdes-Florido, Maria Jose","Lopez-Diaz, Alvaro","Palermo-Zeballos, Fernanda Jazmin","Martinez-Molina, Ivan","Martin-Gil, Victoria Eugenia","Crespo-Facorro, Benedicto","Ruiz-Veguilla, Miguel","32389516"],"abstract":["INTRODUCTION: The world is currently undergoing an extremely stressful scenario due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
