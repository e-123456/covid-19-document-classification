METHODS: An NLS (non-linear least square) method estimated the parameters of a differentiated logistic growth function of new COVID-19 cases in multiple regions in China and nations with a large amount of cases based on training data from Feb. 20 to Mar. 13. A restriction test was subsequently employed to test whether a designated parameter was identical among regions or countries. We conducted diagnosis of the residuals and also its goodness of fit with testing data from Mar. 13 to Apr. 18. FINDINGS: We find that the model fits time series data exceedingly well in China, its provinces, and two other nations, and we provide estimates of key parameters. We reject the null hypothesis that the growth rate of the outbreak is the same among ten selected provinces as well as between South Korea and Iran. We also find that the model does not provide reliable estimates in countries that are in the early stages of outbreak. We further find that the R(2) value be varied and misleading when compared among different curves of the same nonlinear model, as well as the existence of heteroskedasticity and positive serial correlation within residuals in some provinces and nations.

However, the shortage of testing services to detect infected persons makes this approach subject to error due to its underdetection of early cases in the U.S. Our new approach overcomes this limitation and provides data supporting the public policy decisions intended to combat the spread of COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: We used Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data documenting the daily new and cumulative cases of confirmed COVID-19 in the U.S. from January 22 to April 6, 2020, and reconstructed the epidemic using a 5-parameter logistic growth model. We fitted our model to data from a 2-week window (i.e., from March 21 to April 4, approximately one incubation period) during which large-scale testing was being conducted. With parameters obtained from this modeling, we reconstructed and predicted the growth of the epidemic and evaluated the extent and potential effects of underdetection. Results: The data fit the model satisfactorily. The estimated daily growth rate was 16.8% overall with 95% CI: [15.95, 17.76%], suggesting a doubling period of 4 days.
