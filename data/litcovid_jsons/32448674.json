However, it is unclear to what extent this is linked to systemic inflammation and hypercoagulability secondary to the infection. METHODS: We describe the cases of 4 patients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19 who were attended at our hospital. Patients are classified according to the likelihood of a causal relationship between the hypercoagulable state and ischaemic stroke. We also conducted a review of studies addressing the possible mechanisms involved in the aetiopathogenesis of ischaemic stroke in these patients. RESULTS: The association between COVID-19 and stroke was probably causal in 2 patients, who presented cortical infarcts and had no relevant arterial or cardioembolic disease, but did show signs of hypercoagulability and systemic inflammation in laboratory analyses. The other 2 patients were of advanced age and presented cardioembolic ischaemic stroke; the association in these patients was probably incidental. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic inflammation and the potential direct action of the virus may cause endothelial dysfunction, resulting in a hypercoagulable state that could be considered a potential cause of ischaemic stroke. However, stroke involves multiple pathophysiological mechanisms; studies with larger samples are therefore needed to confirm our hypothesis. The management protocol for patients with stroke and COVID-19 should include a complete aetiological study, with the appropriate safety precautions always being observed.","Neurologia","Barrios-Lopez, J M","Rego-Garcia, I","Munoz Martinez, C","Romero-Fabrega, J C","Rivero Rodriguez, M","Ruiz Gimenez, J A","Escamilla-Sevilla, F","Minguez-Castellanos, A","Fernandez Perez, M D","32448674"],"abstract":["INTRODUCTION: Ischaemic stroke has been reported in patients with COVID-19, particularly in more severe cases.

CASE DESCRIPTION: We present two patients with covid-19 and concurrent neurological symptoms. Our first patient is a 31-year-old man who had flu-like symptoms due to covid-19 and later developed an acute-onset severe headache and loss of consciousness and was diagnosed with a Hunt and Hess grade 3 subarachnoid haemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm. Our second patient is a 62-year-old woman who had an ischaemic stroke with massive haemorrhagic conversion requiring a decompressive hemicraniectomy. Both patients' CSF was repeatedly negative on real-time PCR analysis despite concurrent neurological disease.
