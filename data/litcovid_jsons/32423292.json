STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective assessment was performed to the response and management strategy developed to transform the clinical and academic enterprise. SETTING: Large urban tertiary care referral center. RESULTS: The departmental structure was reorganized along new clinical teams to effectively meet the system directives for provision of otolaryngology care and support for inpatient cases of COVID-19.

RESULTS: As of March 25, 2020, almost all (n = 53 of 55, 96.3%) otolaryngology departments had canceled elective cases and were performing only urgent consults.
