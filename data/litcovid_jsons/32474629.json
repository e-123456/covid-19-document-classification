METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed 60 critically ill patients (43 males and 17 females, mean age 64.4 +/- 11.0 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to two different clinical centers. Their clinical and medical records were analyzed, and the chest CT images were assessed to determine the involvement of lobes and the distribution of lesions in the lungs between the patients who recovered from the illness and those who died. RESULTS: Compared with recovered patients (50/60, 83%), deceased patients (10/60, 17%) were older (mean age, 70.6 vs. 62.6 years, p = 0.044). C-reactive protein (CRP) (110.8 +/- 26.3 mg/L vs 63.0 +/- 50.4 mg/L, p < 0.001) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (18.7 +/- 16.6 vs 8.4 +/- 7.5, p = 0.030) were significantly elevated in the deceased as opposed to the recovered.
