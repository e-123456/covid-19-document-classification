As practices are now considering reintroduction of elective endoscopy, we conducted a survey of North American practices to identify reactivation barriers and strategies. METHODS: We designed and electronically distributed a web-based survey to North American gastroenterologists consisting of seven domains: institutional demographics, impact of COVID-19 on endoscopy practice, elective endoscopy resumption plans, anesthesia modifications, personal protective equipment (PPE) policies, fellowship training and telemedicine use. Responses were stratified by practice type: ambulatory surgery center (ASC) or hospital-based. RESULTS: In total, 123 practices (55% ASC-based and 45% hospital-based) responded. At the pandemic's peak (as reported by the respondent), practices saw a 90% drop in endoscopy volume with most centers planning to resume elective endoscopy a median of 55 days after initial restrictions. Declining community prevalence of COVID-19, PPE availability, and pre-procedure SARS-CoV-2 testing availability were ranked as the three primary factors influencing reactivation timing. ASC-based practices were more likely to identify pre-procedure testing availability as a major factor limiting elective endoscopy resumption (p=0.001). Pre-procedure SARS-CoV-2 testing was planned by only 49.2% of practices overall; when testing is performed and negative, 52.9% of practices will continue to utilize N95 masks. CONCLUSION: This survey highlights barriers and variable strategies for reactivation of elective endoscopy services following the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results suggest that more widespread access to pre-procedure SARS-CoV-2 tests with superior performance characteristics is needed to increase provider and patient comfort in proceeding with elective endoscopy.","Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol","Kushnir, Vladimir M","Berzin, Tyler M","Elmunzer, B Joseph","Mendelsohn, Robin B","Patel, Vaishali","Pawa, Swati","Smith, Zachary L","Keswani, Rajesh N","32447019"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Practices dramatically reduced endoscopy services due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Responses collected through April 19, 2020 were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 51/77 (66%) PDs from the United States, Canada and Mexico responded to the survey. 46/51 (90%) PDs reported that they were under a \"stay-at-home\" order for a median of 4 weeks at the time of the survey. 2/51 (4%) programs had fellows participating in outpatient telehealth prior to COVID-19 and 39/51 (76%) at the time of the survey.

We aim to model the impact of PCR testing into resuming endoscopy practice. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of endoscopy utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic for a baseline reference. A computer model compared 3 approaches-Strategy 1: endoscopy for urgent indications only; Strategy 2: testing for semi-urgent indications; and Strategy 3: testing all patients. Analysis was made under current COVID-19 prevalence, and projected prevalence of 5% and 10%. Primary outcomes were number of procedures performed/cancelled. Secondary outcomes were direct costs, reimbursement, personal protective equipment used and personnel infected. Disease prevalence, testing accuracy, and costs were obtained from literature. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, endoscopy volume was 12.7% of expected. Strategy 2 and 3 were safe and effective interventions to resume endoscopy in semi-urgent and elective cases. Investing 22USD and 105USD in testing per patient allowed completing 19.4% and 95.3% of baseline endoscopies respectively.
