METHODS: We report on a family of three adults who experienced photophobia, intense eye pain, epiphora, blurred vision, and burning sensation over the face and neck area after a short period of unprotected exposure to UV germicidal lamps. RESULTS: Initial examination revealed erythema and tenderness over the face and neck area, reduced visual acuity of 6/12, and conjunctival injections bilaterally in all three patients. Further assessment at the ophthalmology department three days later revealed gradual improvement of visual acuity to 6/6 bilaterally. Slit-lamp examinations revealed few punctate epithelial erosions. Fundal examinations were normal without evidence of solar retinopathy. The patients were diagnosed with germicidal-range UV irradiation-induced photokeratitis and epidermal phototoxicity. Lubricants and emollients were prescribed for symptom relief, and the patients were warned against using a UV germicidal lamp for disinfection purposes without appropriate protection. CONCLUSIONS: Although SARS-CoV-2 is structurally akin to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and previous studies demonstrated high levels of inactivation of beta-coronavirus with germicidal-range UV, evidence for its efficacy to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 is lacking. This case report serves to emphasize the potential consequences of phototoxicity from improper use of UV germicidal lamps for household disinfection as well as to highlight the fact that UV germicidal lamps currently have no established role in household disinfection of SARS-CoV-2.","Cornea","Leung, Kai Ching Peter","Ko, Tak Chuen Simon","32355114"],"abstract":["PURPOSE: To report germicidal range ultraviolet (UV) irradiation-induced phototoxicity due to unprotected exposure to UV lamps for presumed household disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 in a domestic setting.

Methods: A modification of the American Society for Testing and Materials standard quantitative carrier disk test method (ASTM E-2197-11) was used to examine the effectiveness of 3 methods, including ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light, a high-level disinfection cabinet that generates aerosolized peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, and dry heat at 70 degrees C for 30 minutes.

Three and 6 log10 reductions on respirators were considered effective for decontamination and disinfection, respectively.
