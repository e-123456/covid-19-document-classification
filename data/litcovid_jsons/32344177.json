Hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin combination therapy is currently tested for curing Covid-19, with promising results. However, the molecular mechanism of action of this combination is not established yet. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations we show that both drugs act in synergy to prevent any close contact between the virus and the plasma membrane of host cells. We reveal unexpected molecular similarity between azithromycin and the sugar moiety of GM1, a lipid raft ganglioside acting as a host attachment cofactor for respiratory viruses. Due to this mimicry, azithromycin interacts with the ganglioside-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This binding site shared by azithromycin and GM1 displays a conserved amino acid triad Q-134/F-135/N-137 located at the tip of the spike protein. We also show that hydroxychloroquine molecules can saturate virus attachment sites on gangliosides in the vicinity of the primary coronavirus receptor ACE-2. Taken together, these data show that azithromycin is directed against the virus, whereas hydroxychloroquine is directed against cellular attachment cofactors. We conclude that both drugs act as competitive inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the host cell membrane. This is consistent with a synergistic antiviral mechanism at the plasma membrane level, where the most efficient therapeutic intervention probably stands. This molecular mechanism may explain the beneficial effects of hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin combination therapy in patients with Covid-19.

Small studies have shown a potential benefit of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine +/- azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19.

Methods - Hospitalized patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine +/- azithromycin from March 1st through the 23rd at three hospitals within the Northwell Health system were included in this prospective, observational study. Serial assessments of the QT interval were performed. The primary outcome was QT prolongation resulting in TdP. Secondary outcomes included QT prolongation, the need to prematurely discontinue any of the medications due to QT prolongation and arrhythmogenic death. Results - Two hundred one patients were treated for COVID-19 with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. Ten patients (5.0%) received chloroquine, 191 (95.0%) received hydroxychloroquine and 119 (59.2%) also received azithromycin. The primary outcome of TdP was not observed in the entire population.
