It was first identified at Wuhan City of China during December 2019. OBJECTIVE: The study to identify top-15 countries with spatial mapping of the confirmed cases. The comparison between identified top-15 countries for confirmed, death and recovery of the cases and further advanced Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) for predicting the spreading of COVID-19 disease trajectories of COVID-19 for next two months. METHODS: The COVID-19 daily data collected and cumulatively represented as spatial map for more than 200 countries and territories. The spatial map useful to identify the intensity of COVID-19 infected people, top-15 countries and continent. The recent reported data for confirmed, death and recovery for last three months was represented and compared in between the top-15 infected countries. The advanced Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) used for predicting the future data based on time-series data. The ARIMA model provide weight to past few values and error values to corrects it model prediction, so it better than other basic regression and exponential methods. The comparison of recent cumulative cases and predicted cases for top-15 countries for confirmed, death and recovery from COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: The top-15 countries, with a high number of confirmed cases are stratified to include its data in mathematical model. The identified top-15 countries cumulative cases, death, and recovery of COVID-19 information were compared. The USA, UK, Turkey, China, Russia relatively fast spreading of disease. The fast recovery ratio in China, Switzerland, Germany, Iran, and Brazil and slow recovery ratio in USA, UK, Netherlands, Russia and Italy. The large number of death rate ratio in Italy, UK and less ratio in Russia, Turkey, China, USA. The ARIMA model used to predict estimated confirmed, death and recovery cases for the top-15 countries for 24 April to 07 July. Its value is represented with 95%, 80% and 70 % confidence interval values. The validation of ARIMA model using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value, its value in the range of 20, 14, and 16 for cumulative confirm cases, death and recovery COVID-19 cases, represents acceptable results. CONCLUSIONS: The observed predicted values represent the confirmed, death and recovery cases gets doubled in all the countries except China, Switzerland and Germany. It was also observed the death and recovery rate were faster as comparison to confirmed cases during next two months. The associated mortality rate will be much higher in USA, Spain, and Italy followed by France, Germany and UK.
