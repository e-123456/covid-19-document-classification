The introductory COVID19 course was launched on 26 January 2020 on the health emergencies learning platform OpenWHO.org. OBJECTIVE: This article investigates the geographic reach of different language courses accessed by a global audience seeking information on COVID-19. Users' professional identities and background are explored to inform course owners on the use case. The course was developed and delivered via the open-access learning platform OpenWHO.org. The self-paced resources available in a total of 13 languages were produced between 26 January and 25 March 2020. METHODS: Data was collected from the online courses' statistical data and metrics reporting system on the OpenWHO platform. User patterns and locations were analysed based on Google Analytics and the platform's own statistics capabilities, with data sets overlaid. This analysis was conducted based on user location, with the data disaggregated according to the six WHO regions, their top 10 countries and the proportion of use for each language version. Data included affiliation, gender, age and other parameters for approximately 30% of users who indicated their background. RESULTS: As of 25 March 2020, the introductory COVID-19 course totalled 232 890 enrolments across all languages. The Spanish language course comprised more than half (51%) of all course enrolments, while the English language course comprised 37% of enrolments. WHO's Region of the Americas accounted for most of the course enrolments, with more than 72% across all languages. Other regions were more evenly distributed with less than 10% each. 32.4% of users specified professional affiliation by choosing from the 12 most common backgrounds in OpenWHO's user profiles. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, users were spread over the 11 distinct affiliations with small fractions of users identifying themselves as \"Other\". With the COVID-19 introductory course, the largest number of users selected \"Other\" (31.7%) suggesting a large non-health professional and academic user load. The top 10 countries of users across all languages were Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Mexico, Peru, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. CONCLUSIONS: The online course has addressed a global learning need by providing WHO technical guidance packaged in simple formats for access and use. The learning material development was expedited to meet the onset of the epidemic. Initial data suggests that the various language versions of the course, in particular Spanish, have reached new user groups, fulfilling the platform's aim of providing learning everywhere to anyone interested. User surveys will be carried out to measure real impact.

A solid communication strategy is needed to increase the reach of valid information to health professionals, reduce misinformation, and efficiently implement recommended measures. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to describe the utilization of a dedicated mHealth platform to disseminate up-to-date and validated information about the SARS-CoV-2 to all medical staff of the Children's Hospital at the University Hospitals of Geneva. METHODS: Three documents containing institutional information concerning screening, local containment procedures as well as FAQ for parents were made available to the staff through a mobile application developed in the University of Geneva, Switzerland. Using a third-party statistics tool, we anonymously monitored user activity as well as content utilization patterns since the diagnostic of the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland on February 25, 2020. RESULTS: During the period of February 25 to March 13, 2020 (18 days) information documents on SARS-CoV-2 were viewed 859 times which amounted for 35.6% of total content views. User activity increased significantly with 50.8 (SD = 14.4) vs 26.4 (SD = 9.8) users per day comparing to previous weeks (p < 0.001).
