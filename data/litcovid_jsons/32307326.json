Oral cancer patients are susceptible often immunosuppressed due to the disease and/or the treatment received. METHODS: We performed a simulationof the currently available data using a multi state and hazards model to provide an objective model for counseling and decision making for healthcare workers. RESULTS: Stage IV oral cancer patients that did not receive treatment had progression of disease and an increased mortality rate than patients that receive treatment but did not contract COVID-19. The patients that received treatment and got affected with COVID-19 had a far worse impact and higher mortality rate than all other groups. CONCLUSION: Isolation and deferring treatment for stage IV oral cancer patients, so as to avoid hospital visits and contration of COVID-19, is an advisable strategy based on this model.
