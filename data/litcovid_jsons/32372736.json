The topical recombinant human acidic fibroblast growth factor (rh-aFGF) was used to cure pressure sores for healthcare workers at Zhongfaxincheng campus of Tongji Hospital. The results from a small sample size survey conducted in Zhongfaxincheng campuses of Tongji Hospital showed that treatment with topical rh-aFGF could significantly inhibit the progression of pressure sores and accelerate the wound healing with no apparent ill-effects.
