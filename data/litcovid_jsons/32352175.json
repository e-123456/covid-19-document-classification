Results: There was no significant difference in theoretical, practical, and total examination scores between the two groups, but in terms of teaching satisfaction, the overall satisfaction, the degree of easy understanding, the evaluation of teachers and learning results in the experimental group were higher than those in the control group, with statistical difference (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Compared with the traditional teaching methods, the effect of combined mode of MOOC micro-video in emergency nursing practice is the same as that of traditional teaching methods, but the satisfaction is higher, so it is more suitable to be used in nursing practice during the COVID-19 epidemic period, so as to effectively reduce the cross-infection between doctors, nurses, and teaching staff.","Telemed J E Health","Zhou, Ting","Huang, Sufang","Cheng, Jing","Xiao, Yaru","32271650"],"abstract":["Objective: To observe and analyze the application effect of the combined mode of Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) micro-video during the COVID-19 epidemic period in the distance teaching practice of interns in the emergency department.
