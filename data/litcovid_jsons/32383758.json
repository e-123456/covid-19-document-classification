The first step in SARS-CoV-2 infection is binding of the virus to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the airway epithelium. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to gain insight into the expression of ACE2 in the human airway epithelium. METHODS: Airway epithelium sampled by fiberoptic bronchoscopy of trachea, large airway epi-thelium (LAE) and small airway epithelium (SAE) of nonsmokers and smokers was analyzed for expression of ACE2 and other coronavirus infection-related genes using microarray, RNA-seq and 10x single cell transcriptome analysis, with associated examination of ACE2-related miRNA. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: (1) ACE2 is expressed similarly in the trachea and LAE with lower expression in the SAE; (2) in the SAE, ACE2 is expressed in basal, intermediate, club, mu-cus and ciliated cells; (3) ACE2 is up-regulated in the SAE by smoking, significantly in males; (4) levels of miR-1246 expression could play a role in ACE2 up-regulation in the SAE of smokers; and (5) ACE2 is expressed in airway epithelium differentiated in vitro on air-liquid interface cultures from primary airway basal stem/progenitor cells; this can be replicated using LAE and SAE immortalized basal cell lines derived from healthy nonsmokers. CONCLUSIONS: ACE2, the gene encoding the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is expressed in the human airway epithelium, with variations in expression relevant to the biology of initial steps in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, it is currently unclear whether conjunctival epithelial cells express ACE2 and its cofactors. In this study, a total of 38 conjunctival samples from 38 patients, including 12 healthy conjunctiva, 12 melanoma, 7 squamous cell carcinoma and 7 papilloma samples, were analyzed using high-throughput RNA sequencing to assess mRNA expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and its cofactors including TMPRSS2, ANPEP, DPP4, and ENPEP. ACE2 protein expression was assessed in eight healthy conjunctival samples using immunohistochemistry. Our results show that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is not substantially expressed in conjunctival samples on the mRNA (median 0.0 transcripts per million (TPM), min 0.0 TPM, max 1.7 TPM) and protein levels. Similar results were obtained for the transcription of other auxiliary molecules. In conclusion, this study finds no evidence for a significant expression of ACE2 and its auxiliary mediators for cell entry in conjunctival samples, making conjunctival infection with SARS-CoV-2 via these mediators unlikely.
