METHODS: We retrospectively collected chest CT exams including n = 498 on 151 unique patients RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 and n = 497 unique patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Both COVID-19 and CAP image sets were partitioned into three groups for training, validation, and testing respectively.

We also asked two experienced radiologists to visually interpret the testing set and discriminate COVID-19 from CAP. The classification performance of the computer algorithms and the radiologists was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the nonparametric approaches with multiplicity adjustments when necessary. RESULTS: One of the considered models showed non-trivial, but moderate diagnostic ability overall (AUC of 0.70 with 99% CI 0.56-0.85).

It is still unclear how fast the virus evolved and how the virus interacts with other microorganisms in the lung. METHODS: We have conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of eight SARS-CoV-2 patients, 25 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients, and 20 healthy controls. RESULTS: The median number of intra-host variants was 1-4 in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, which ranged between 0 and 51 in different samples. The distribution of variants on genes was similar to those observed in the population data (110 sequences). However, very few intra-host variants were observed in the population as polymorphism, implying either a bottleneck or purifying selection involved in the transmission of the virus, or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism data. Although current evidence did not support the transmission of intra-host variants in a person-to-person spread, the risk should not be overlooked. The microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was similar to those in CAP, either dominated by the pathogens or with elevated levels of oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria.
