SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA beta-coronavirus that primarily targets the human respiratory system, with fever, cough, myalgia, and pneumonia as the most common manifestations. However, since SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool specimens much more attention has been paid to gastrointestinal symptoms such as loss of appetite, nausea, and diarrhea. Furthermore, the expression of ACE-2 receptors in absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon suggests that these organs should also be considered as a potential high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. During aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMP; e.g. intubating and extubating patients or any surgical procedures), the production of both airborne particles and droplets may increase the risk of infection. In this situation, the surgical staff is strongly recommended to wear personal protective equipment (PPE). A transparent plastic cube, the so-called \"Aerosol Box\" (AB), has been recently designed to lend further protection against droplets and aerosol exposure during the AGMP.","Updates Surg","Bianco, F","Incollingo, P","Grossi, U","Gallo, G","32449034"],"abstract":["The COVID-19 pandemic is highly challenging for the operating room staff and healthcare workers in emergency departments.
