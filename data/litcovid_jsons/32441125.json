METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a large urban tertiary care medical center. Thirty-two patients undergoing operative procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic were placed into 2 preoperative screening protocols. Early in the pandemic a \"high-risk case protocol\" was utilized to maximize available resources. As information and technology evolved, a \"universal point-of-care protocol\" was implemented. RESULTS: Of 32 patients, 25 were screened prior to surgery. Three (12%) tested positive for COVID-19. In all 3 cases, the procedure was delayed, and patients were admitted for treatment or discharged under home quarantine. During this period, 86% of operative procedures were indicated for treatment of oncologic disease. There was no significant delay in arrival to the operating room for patients undergoing point-of-care screening immediately prior to their procedure (P = .92). DISCUSSION: Currently, few studies address preoperative screening for COVID-19. A substantial proportion of individuals in this cohort tested positive, and both protocols identified positive cases. The major strengths of the point-of-care protocol are ease of administration, avoiding subsequent exposures after testing, and relieving strain on \"COVID-19 clinics\" or other community testing facilities. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Preoperative screening is a critical aspect of safe surgical practice in the midst of the widespread pandemic.

However, persons at greatest risk for poor mental health outcomes, such as persons with serious mental illness, have been largely overlooked. OBJECTIVE: To examine the mental health impact of COVID-19 and social distancing behaviors among persons with serious mental illness and the behaviors taken to prevent COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Participants will include individuals with serious mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) and non-psychiatric control participants who are currently or previously participated in several ongoing parent observational studies. Data will be collected from April, 2020 through August, 2020. Participants will complete phone interviews at two time points to assess their current emotional functioning and measures they have taken to prevent COVID-19 infection. Baseline (pre-COVID-19) mental health, sampled by ecological momentary assessment over an extended period, will be compared with current mental health, sampled by ecological momentary assessment over an extended period, and demographic, cognitive and psychosocial factors at baseline will be used to examine risk and resilience to current mental health and coping. RESULTS: Study results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. CONCLUSIONS: Findings have broad implications for understanding the psychological consequences of COVID-19 among vulnerable persons with serious mental illness, and will provide the opportunity to identify targets to reduce negative outcomes in the future. We also hope our efforts will provide a roadmap and resources for other researchers who would like to implement a similar approach.
