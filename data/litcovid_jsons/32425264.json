OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pathologic changes of organ systems and the clinicopathologic basis for severe and fatal outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective autopsy study. SETTING: Single pathology department. PARTICIPANTS: 11 deceased patients with COVID-19 (10 of whom were selected at random for autopsy). MEASUREMENTS: Systematic macroscopic, histopathologic, and viral analysis (SARS-CoV-2 on real-time polymerase chain reaction assay), with correlation of pathologic and clinical features, including comorbidities, comedication, and laboratory values. RESULTS: Patients' age ranged from 66 to 91 years (mean, 80.5 years; 8 men, 3 women). Ten of the 11 patients received prophylactic anticoagulant therapy; venous thromboembolism was not clinically suspected antemortem in any of the patients. Both lungs showed various stages of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), including edema, hyaline membranes, and proliferation of pneumocytes and fibroblasts.
