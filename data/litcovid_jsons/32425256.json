This study aimed to explore the relationship between ambient air pollutants and the infection caused by the novel coronavirus. Daily confirmed cases, air pollution concentration and meteorological variables in 120 cities were obtained from January 23, 2020 to February 29, 2020 in China. We applied a generalized additive model to investigate the associations of six air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2 and O3) with COVID-19 confirmed cases. We observed significantly positive associations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3 in the last two weeks with newly COVID-19 confirmed cases. A 10-mug/m(3) increase (lag0-14) in PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3 was associated with a 2.24% (95% CI: 1.02 to 3.46), 1.76% (95% CI: 0.89 to 2.63), 6.94% (95% CI: 2.38 to 11.51), and 4.76% (95% CI: 1.99 to 7.52) increase in the daily counts of confirmed cases, respectively.

DESIGN: A retrospective cohort during Jan 25th to Feb 29th in 2020. SETTING: City of Wuhan, XiaoGan and HuangGang. PATIENTS: The COVID-19 incidence per day. METHODS: We collected daily data of COVID-19 incidence, eight ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, and O3-8h) and three meteorological variables (temperature, relative humidity and wind level) in China's three worst COVID-19 hit cities during the study period. The multivariate Poisson regression was performed to understand their correlation. RESULTS: Our data showed that daily COVID-19 incidence was positively associated with PM2.5 and humidity in all cities. Specifically, the relative risk (RR) of PM2.5 was 1.036 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.032 -1.039), 1.059 (95% CL, 1.046 - 1.072) and 1.144 (95% CL, 1.12 - 1.169) for COVID-19 incidence per day in Wuhan, XiaoGan and HuangGang, respectively. The RR of humidity was constantly lower than that of PM2.5, whose difference ranged from 0.027 to 0.111.
