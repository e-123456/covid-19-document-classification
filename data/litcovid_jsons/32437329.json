OBJECTIVE: Objective: We assess the extent to which interest in preparing guns has increased amid the COVID-19 Pandemic using data from Google searches related to purchasing and cleaning guns. METHODS: Methods: We fit an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model over Google search data from January 2004 up until the week that President Trump declared COVID-19 an emergency. We use this model to forecast Google search volumes, creating a counterfactual of the number of gun preparation searches we would expect if not for COVID-19, and report observed deviations from this counterfactual. RESULTS: Results: Google searches related to preparing guns have surged to unprecedented levels, approximately 40% higher than previously reported spikes following the Sandy Hook, CT and Parkland, FL shootings and 158% (95%CI 73-270) greater than would be expected if not for COVID-19. In absolute terms, there were approximately 2.1 million searches related to gun preparation over just 34 days. States severely affected by COVID-19 appear to have among the greatest increases in searches. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions: Our results corroborate media reports that gun purchases are increasing amid the Pandemic and provide more precise geographic and temporal trends.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated online search behavior related to the COVID-19 outbreak and the attitudes of \"infodemic monikers\" (ie, erroneous information that gives rise to interpretative mistakes, fake news, episodes of racism, etc) circulating in Italy. METHODS: By using Google Trends to explore the internet search activity related to COVID-19 from January to March 2020, article titles from the most read newspapers and government websites were mined to investigate the attitudes of infodemic monikers circulating across various regions and cities in Italy. Search volume values and average peak comparison (APC) values were used to analyze the results. RESULTS: Keywords such as \"novel coronavirus,\" \"China coronavirus,\" \"COVID-19,\" \"2019-nCOV,\" and \"SARS-COV-2\" were the top infodemic and scientific COVID-19 terms trending in Italy. The top five searches related to health were \"face masks,\" \"amuchina\" (disinfectant), \"symptoms of the novel coronavirus,\" \"health bulletin,\" and \"vaccines for coronavirus.\" The regions of Umbria and Basilicata recorded a high number of infodemic monikers (APC weighted total >140).
