Previous studies predominantly focused on its place of origin, Wuhan, causing over estimation of the disease severity due to selection bias.

METHODS: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and management data from qRT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients from January 17 to January 31, 2020 was collected, followed by multivariate logistic-regression analysis for independent predictors of severe/critical type COVID-19 and bioinformatic analysis for features of SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province. RESULTS: Among 465 COVID-19 patients, median age was 45 years while hypertension, diabetes, and chronic liver disease were the most common comorbidities. History of exposure to the epidemic area was present in 170 (36.56%) and 185 (39.78%) patients were clustered in 77 families. Severe/critical type of COVID-19 developed in 49 (10.54%) patients.

The performance of the nomogram regarding the C-index, calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness was assessed. Internal validation was assessed by bootstrapping. RESULTS: The median age of the cohort was 43 years. Severe patients were older than mild patients by a median of 6 years. Fever, cough, and dyspnea were more common in severe patients. The individualized prediction nomogram included seven predictors: body temperature at admission, cough, dyspnea, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic liver disease, and chronic kidney disease. The model had good discrimination with an area under the curve of 0.862, C-index of 0.863 (95% confidence interval, 0.801-0.925), and good calibration. A high C-index value of 0.839 was reached in the interval validation. Decision curve analysis showed that the prediction nomogram was clinically useful. CONCLUSION: We established an early warning model incorporating clinical characteristics that could be quickly obtained on admission. This model can be used to help predict severe COVID-19 and identify patients at risk of developing severe disease."],"journal":"PLoS One","authors":["Zhou, Yiwu","He, Yanqi","Yang, Huan","Yu, He","Wang, Ting","Chen, Zhu","Yao, Rong","Liang, Zongan"],"date":"2020-05-19T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32421703","source":"PubMed","week":"202021|May 18 - May 24","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0233328","locations":["Wuhan","Sichuan","Sichuan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Treatment","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1667159284462387201,"score":162.93842}]}
