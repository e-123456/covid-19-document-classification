Conventional coagulation assays, D-dimer levels, and viscoelastic parameters were analyzed using a receiver operating characteristic curve to predict thromboembolic outcomes and new onset renal failure. RESULTS: Forty-four patients with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Derangements in coagulation laboratory values including elevated D-Dimer, fibrinogen, PT, and PTT were confirmed; viscoelastic parameters showed an elevated maximum amplitude and low lysis at 30 minutes.
