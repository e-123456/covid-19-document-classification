CASE DESCRIPTION: A 78-year-old male underwent an extended endoscopic endonasal transplanum resection of a pituitary macroadenoma for decompression of the optic chiasm. The resulting skull base defect was repaired using a pedicled nasoseptal flap (NSF). The patient developed meningitis and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak on post-operative day thirteen requiring revision repair of the defect. Twelve days later, he developed persistent fevers and rhinorrhea. The patient was re-explored endoscopically, and the NSF was noted to be necrotic and devitalized with evident CSF leakage. At that time, the patient tested positive for Sars-CoV-2. Post-operatively, he developed acute respiratory distress syndrome complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and death.
