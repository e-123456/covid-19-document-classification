The pandemic and the ensuing rapid changes to medical practice have particularly affected head and neck cancer surgeons and their patients. In an effort to balance the needs of our patients with the risks to patient and staff safety, we have been tasked with finding alternatives to the traditional office visit. In this commentary, we discuss how telemedicine can be incorporated into the head and neck surgery practice, the challenges that we have faced, and the dilemmas with which we have dealt in our efforts to fulfill the ongoing need for care of this unique patient population.","Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg","Triantafillou, Vasiliki","Rajasekaran, Karthik","32340542"],"abstract":["The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented and historic event that presents unique challenges to patient care to medical providers worldwide.

METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to head and neck surgeons assessing opinions related to treatment and concerns for the safety of patients, self, family, and staff. RESULTS: A total of 67 head and neck surgeons responded during the study period. Surgeons continued to recommend primary surgical treatment for oral cavity cancers. Respondents were more likely to consider non-surgical therapy for patients with early glottic cancers and HPV-mediated oropharynx cancer. Surgeons were least likely to be concerned for their own health and safety and had the greatest concern for their resident trainees. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights differences in the willingness of head and neck surgeons to delay surgery or alter plans during times when hospital resources are scarce and risk is high.
