METHODS: Anonymized data from the regional psychiatric care register have been obtained and analyzed. The seven GHPWs care for approximately 1.4 million inhabitants and have a total of 119 beds. RESULTS: In the 40-day period (February 21st-March 31st 2020) after the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, compared to a similar 40-day period prior to 21 February, and compared to two 40-day periods of 2019, there has been a marked reduction in psychiatric admission rates. The reduction was explained by voluntary admissions, while there was not a noticeable reduction for involuntary admissions. The reduction was visible for all diagnostic groups, except for a group of 'Other' diagnoses, which includes anxiety disorders, neurocognitive disorders, etc. CONCLUSIONS: Large-scale pandemics can modify voluntary admission rates to psychiatric facilities in the early phases following pandemic onset. We suggest that the reduction in admission rates may be due to fear of hospitals, seen as possible sites of contagion, as well as to a change in thresholds of behavioural problems acting as a trigger for admission requests from family relatives or referrals from treating clinicians.
