Confirmed modes of viral transmission are primarily but not exclusively contact with contaminated environmental surfaces and aerosolization.

(2) Place a wire basket lined with a zip closure plastic bag, on the IV pole to the right of the provider. Place all contaminated instruments in the bag (i.e. laryngoscope blades and handles) and close. Designate and maintain clean and dirty areas. After induction of anesthesia, wipe down all equipment and surfaces with disinfection wipes that contain a quaternary ammonium compound and alcohol. Use a top down cleaning sequence adequate to reduce bioburden. Treat operating rooms using UV-C. (3) Decolonize patients using pre-procedural chlorhexidine wipes, 2 doses of nasal povidone iodine within one hour of incision, and chlorhexidine mouth rinse.
