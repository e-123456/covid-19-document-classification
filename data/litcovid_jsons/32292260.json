OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the level of awareness, perception, and attitude regarding COVID-19 and infection control among Jordanian dentists. METHODS: The study population consisted of dentists who work in private clinics, hospitals, and health centers in Jordan. An online questionnaire was sent to a sample of Jordanian dentists in March 2020. The questionnaire comprised a series of questions about dentists' demographic characteristics, their awareness of incubation period, the symptoms of the disease, mode of transmission of the COVID-19, and infection control measures for preventing COVID-19, and their attitude toward treating patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: This study included a total of 368 dentists aged from 22 to 73 year with a mean (SD) of 32.9 (10.6) year. A total of 112 (30.4%) had completed a master or residency program in dentistry, 195 (53.0%) had received training in infection control in dentistry, and 28 (7.6%) had attended training or received lectures regarding COVID-19. A total of 133 (36.1%) dentists reported that the incubation period is 1-14 days. The majority of dentists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and ways of how to identify patients at risk of having COVID-19, were able to correctly report known modes of transmission and were aware of measures for preventing COVID-19 transmission in dental clinics. A total of 275 (74.7%) believed that it is necessary to ask patients to sit far from each other, wear masks while in the waiting room, and wash hands before getting in the dental chair to decrease disease transmission.
