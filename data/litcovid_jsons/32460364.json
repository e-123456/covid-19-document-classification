METHODS: Cases were collected from three pediatric surgical wards. Comparison between complicated appendicitis rates in the COVID-19 era and similar period in previous year was performed. RESULTS: All seven children presented with complicated appendicitis. Main reasons for the delayed diagnosis during the COVID-19 era were parental concern, telemedicine use and insufficient evaluation. Higher complication rates were found during the COVID-19 era compared to similar period in previous year (22% vs. 11%, p-value 0.06). CONCLUSION: The fear from COVID-19 pandemic may result in delayed diagnosis and higher complication rates in common pediatric medical conditions. We believe care givers as well as healthcare providers should not withhold necessary medical care since delay in diagnosis and treatment in these routinely seen medical emergencies may become as big of a threat as COVID-19 itself.","Acta Paediatr","Snapiri, Ori","Rosenberg Danziger, Chen","Krause, Irit","Kravarusic, Dragan","Yulevich, Alon","Balla, Uri","Bilavsky, Efraim","32460364"],"abstract":["AIM: To present seven pediatric patients with appendicitis, all with late diagnosis resulting from different aspects of the fear from the current global COVID-19 pandemic.

The aim of this study was to compare the incidence and severity of AA before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed between December 2019 and April 2020 in the four high-volume centres that provide health care to the municipality of Jerusalem, Israel. Two groups were created. Group A consisted of patients who presented in the 7 weeks prior to COVID-19 first being diagnosed, whilst those in the 7 weeks after were allocated to Group B. A comparison was performed between the clinicopathological features of the patients in each group as was the changing incidence of AA. RESULTS: A total of 378 patients were identified, 237 in Group A and 141 in Group B (62.7% vs. 37.3%). Following the onset of COVID-19, the weekly incidence of AA decreased by 40.7% (p = 0.02). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the length of preoperative symptoms or surgery, need for postoperative peritoneal drainage or the distribution of complicated versus uncomplicated appendicitis.
