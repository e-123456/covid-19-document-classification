METHODS: Cases were collected from three pediatric surgical wards. Comparison between complicated appendicitis rates in the COVID-19 era and similar period in previous year was performed. RESULTS: All seven children presented with complicated appendicitis. Main reasons for the delayed diagnosis during the COVID-19 era were parental concern, telemedicine use and insufficient evaluation. Higher complication rates were found during the COVID-19 era compared to similar period in previous year (22% vs. 11%, p-value 0.06). CONCLUSION: The fear from COVID-19 pandemic may result in delayed diagnosis and higher complication rates in common pediatric medical conditions. We believe care givers as well as healthcare providers should not withhold necessary medical care since delay in diagnosis and treatment in these routinely seen medical emergencies may become as big of a threat as COVID-19 itself.","Acta Paediatr","Snapiri, Ori","Rosenberg Danziger, Chen","Krause, Irit","Kravarusic, Dragan","Yulevich, Alon","Balla, Uri","Bilavsky, Efraim","32460364"],"abstract":["AIM: To present seven pediatric patients with appendicitis, all with late diagnosis resulting from different aspects of the fear from the current global COVID-19 pandemic.
