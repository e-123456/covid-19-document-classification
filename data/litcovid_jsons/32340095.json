Methods: We collected demographic data, medical histories, clinical courses and outcomes of 1 350 COVID-19 patients reported in Guangdong as of 4 March 2020 via epidemiological investigation and process tracking. Disease severity and clinical course characteristics of the patients and influencing factors of severe illness were analyzed in our study. Results: Among 1 350 cases of COVID-19 cases in Guangdong, 72 (5.3%) and 1049 (77.7%) were mild and ordinary cases, 164 (12.1%) were severe cases, 58 (4.3%) were critical cases and 7 (0.5%) were fatal. The median duration of illness were 23 days (P(25)-P(75): 18-31 days) and the median length of hospitalization were 20 days (P(25)-P(75): 15-27 days). For severe cases, the median time of showing severe manifestations was on the 12th day after onset (P(25)-P(75): 9th to 15th days), and the median time of severe manifestation lasted for 8 days P(25)-P(75): 4-14 days). Among 1 066 discharged/fetal cases, 36.4% (36/99) and 1.0% (1/99) of the mild cases developed to ordinary cases and severe cases respectively after admission; and 5.2% (50/968) and 0.6% (6/968) of the ordinary cases developed to severe cases, and critical cases respectively after admission. In severe cases, 11.4% developed to critical cases (10/88). The influencing factors for severe illness or worse included male (aHR=1.87, 95%CI: 1.43-2.46), older age (aHR=1.67, 95%CI: 1.51-1.85), seeking medical care on day 2-3 after onset (aHR=1.73, 95%CI: 1.20-2.50) pre-existing diabetes (aHR=1.75, 95%CI: 1.12-2.73) and hypertension (aHR=1.49, 95%CI: 1.06-2.09). Conclusions: The course of illness and length of hospitalization of COVID-19 cases were generally long and associated with severity of disease clinical outcomes. The severe cases were mainly occurred in populations at high risk. In the epidemic period, classified management of COVID-19 cases should be promoted according to needs for control and prevention of isolation and treatment for the purpose of rational allocation of medical resources.","Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi","Zhang, Y T","Deng, A P","Hu, T","Chen, X G","Zhuang, Y L","Tan, X H","Zhen, H Z","Sun, L M","Li, Y","Zhong, H J","He, J F","Song, T","Kang, M","32340095"],"abstract":["Objective: To analyze the clinical courses and outcomes of COVID-19 cases and the influencing factors in Guangdong province and provide basis for the formulation or adjustment of medical care and epidemic control strategy for COVID-19.

Objectives: To describe the clinical course of severe and critical infection in hospitalized pregnant women with positive laboratory testing for SARS-CoV2. Study Design: This is a cohort study of pregnant women with severe or critical COVID-19 infection hospitalized at 12 US institutions between March 5, 2020 and April 20, 2020. Severe infection was defined according to published criteria by patient reported dyspnea, respiratory rate > 30 per minute, blood oxygen saturation </= 93% on room air, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen <300 and/or lung infiltrates >50% within 24 to 48 hours on chest imaging. Critical disease was defined by respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. Women were excluded if they had presumed COVID-19 infection but laboratory testing was negative. The primary outcome was median duration from hospital admission to discharge. Secondary outcomes included need for supplemental oxygen, intubation, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, death, and timing of delivery. The clinical courses are described by the median disease day on which these outcomes occurred after the onset of symptoms. Treatment and neonatal outcomes are also reported. Results: Of 64 pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19, 44 (69%) had severe and 20 (31%) critical disease. The following pre-existing comorbidities were observed: 25% had a pulmonary condition, 17% had cardiac disease and the mean BMI was 34 kg/m(2). Gestational age at symptom onset was at a mean 29 +/-6 weeks and at hospital admission a mean of 30 +/-6 weeks, on a median day of disease 7 since first symptoms. Eighty-one percent of women were treated with hydroxychloroquine; 9% of women with severe disease and 65% of women with critical disease received remdesivir. All women with critical disease received either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation during their admission. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (6 days for severe, 10.5 days for critical, p=0.01). For those who required it, intubation usually occurred around day 9, and peak respiratory support for women with severe disease occurred on day 8.

Conclusion: In hospitalized pregnant women with severe or critical COVID-19 infection, admission typically occurred about 7 days after symptom onset, and the duration of hospitalization was 6 days (6 severe versus 12 critical).

Therefore, we used spatial autocorrelation and Spearman's rank correlation methods to investigate these two topics, respectively. The COVID-19 epidemic data reported publicly and relevant open data in Hubei province were analyzed. The results showed that (1) at both prefecture and county levels, the global spatial autocorrelation was extremely significant for the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases (CCC) in Hubei province from 30 January to 18 February 2020. Further, (2) at both levels, the significant hotspot and cluster/outlier area was observed solely in Wuhan city and most of its districts/sub-cities from 30 January to 18 February 2020. (3) At the prefecture level in Hubei province, the number of CCC had a positive and extremely significant correlation (p < 0.01) with the registered population (RGP), resident population (RSP), Baidu migration index (BMI), regional gross domestic production (GDP), and total retail sales of consumer goods (TRS), respectively, from 29 January to 18 February 2020 and had a negative and significant correlation (p < 0.05) with minimum elevation (MINE) from 2 February to 18 February 2020, but no association with the land area (LA), population density (PD), maximum elevation (MAXE), mean elevation (MNE), and range of elevation (RAE) from 23 January to 18 February 2020. (4) At the county level, the number of CCC in Hubei province had a positive and extremely significant correlation (p < 0.01) with PD, RGP, RSP, GDP, and TRS, respectively, from 27 January to 18 February 2020, and was negatively associated with MINE, MAXE, MNE, and RAE, respectively, from 26 January to 18 February 2020, and negatively associated with LA from 30 January to 18 February 2020. It suggested that (1) the COVID-19 epidemic at both levels in Hubei province had evident characteristics of significant global spatial autocorrelations and significant centralized high-risk outbreaks, and had an extremely significant association with social and economic factors. (2) The COVID-19 epidemics were significantly associated with the natural factors, such as LA, MAXE, MNE, and RAE, -only at the county level, not at the prefecture level, from 2 February to 18 February 2020. (3) The COVID-19 epidemics were significantly related to the socioeconomic factors, such as RGP, RSP, TRS, and GDP, at both levels from 26 January to 18 February 2020. It is desired that this study enrich our understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns and influencing factors of the COVID-19 epidemic and benefit classified prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic for policymakers.","Int J Environ Res Public Health","Xiong, Yongzhu","Wang, Yunpeng","Chen, Feng","Zhu, Mingyong","32486403"],"abstract":["The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has had a crucial influence on people's lives and socio-economic development throughout China and across the globe since December 2019. An understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns and influencing factors of the COVID-19 epidemic on multiple scales could benefit the control of the outbreak. Therefore, we used spatial autocorrelation and Spearman's rank correlation methods to investigate these two topics, respectively.
