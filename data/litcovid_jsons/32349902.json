METHODS: Urologic trainees and attending physicians at our institution, who are familiar with existing safety recommendations and guidelines regarding the care of infected patients, were queried regarding their experiences to determine an expert consensus on best practices for bedside procedures for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. RESULTS: Our team developed the following general recommendations for urologic interventions on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients: maximize use of telehealth (even for inpatient consults), minimize in-room time, use personal protective equipment appropriately, enlist a colleague to assist, and acquire all supplies that may be needed and maintain them outside the room. Detailed recommendations were also developed for difficult urethral catheterization, bedside cystoscopy, incision and drainage of abscesses, and gross hematuria/clot irrigations. CONCLUSIONS: As patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection are predominantly men over 50 years old, there are significant urologic challenges common in this population that have emerged with this pandemic.
