Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is hereby applied to identify the marketed drugs with potential for treating COVID-19. Material and methods: An AI platform was established to identify potential old drugs with anti-coronavirus activities by using two different learning databases; one consisted of the compounds reported or proven active against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus, and the other one containing the known 3C-like protease inhibitors.
