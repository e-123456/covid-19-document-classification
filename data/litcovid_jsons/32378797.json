This paper summarises data from the first two weeks of the study. METHODS: COVED is an ongoing prospective cohort study that commenced on 1 April 2020. It includes all adult patients presenting to a participating ED who undergo testing for SARS-Cov-2. Data are collected prospectively and entered into a bespoke registry. Outcomes include a positive SARS-Cov-2 PCR test result and requirement for intensive respiratory support. RESULTS: In the period 1-14 April 2020, 240 (16%) of 1508 patients presenting to The Alfred Emergency & Trauma Centre met inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 (5%) tested positive for SARS-Cov-2. The mean age of patients was 60 years and the commonest symptoms were acute shortness of breath (122 [67%]), cough (108 [56%]) or fever (98 [51%]). Overseas travel or known contact with a confirmed case was reported by 24 (14%) and 16 (10%), respectively. Fever or hypoxia was recorded in 23 (10%) and 11 (5%) patients respectively. Eleven patients (5%) received mechanical ventilation in the ED, of whom none tested positive for SARS-Cov-2. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients presenting to a tertiary ED with suspected COVID-19, only a small proportion tested positive for SARS-Cov-2. Although the low incidence of positive cases currently precludes the development of predictive tools, the COVED Project demonstrates that the rapid establishment of an agile clinical registry for emergency care is feasible.","Emerg Med Australas","O'Reilly, G M","Mitchell, R D","Rajiv, P","Wu, J","Brennecke, H","Brichko, L","Noonan, M P","Hiller, R","Mitra, B","Luckhoff, C","Paton, A","Smit, D V","Santamaria, M J","Cameron, P A","32378797"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 Emergency Department (COVED) Quality Improvement Project aims to provide regular and real-time clinical information to ED clinicians caring for patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19.

We report the preliminary results of a targeted program of COVID-19 infection testing in the ED in the first 10 days of its initiation at our institution. METHODS: We conducted a review of prospectively collected data on all ED patients who had targeted testing for acute COVID-19 infection at two EDs during the initial 10 days of testing (March 10-19, 2020). During this initial period with limited resources, testing was targeted toward high-risk patients per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Data collected from patients who were tested included demographics, clinical characteristics, and test qualifying criteria. We present the data overall and by test results with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: During the 10-day study period, the combined census of the study EDs was 2157 patient encounters. A total of 283 tests were ordered in the ED. The majority of patients were 18-64 years of age, male, non-Hispanic white, had an Emergency Severity Index score of three, did not have a fever, and were discharged from the ED. A total of 29 (10.2%) tested positive. Symptoms-based criteria most associated with COVID-19 were the most common criteria identified for testing (90.6%). All other criteria were reported in 5.51-43.0% of persons being tested. Having contact with a person under investigation was significantly more common in those who tested positive compared to those who tested negative (63% vs 24.5%, respectively).
