OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of burnout between physicians and nurses on the front line and those working in usual wards. METHODS: A survey with 49 questions total was administered to 220 medical staff members from the COVID-19 front lines and usual wards, with a ratio of 1:1. General information such as age, gender, marriage status, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Medical Personnel (MBI), were gathered and compared. RESULTS: The group working on the front lines had a lower frequency of burnout (13% versus 39%, P < .0001), and were less worried about being infected compared to the usual ward group. CONCLUSION: Compared to medical staff working on their usual wards for uninfected patients, medical staff working on the COVID-19 front line had a lower frequency of burnout.
