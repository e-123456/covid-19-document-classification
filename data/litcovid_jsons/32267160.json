Thereafter, consolidations generally dissipated into GGO and the frequency of GGO increased in the 3rd week (76.5%) and 4th week (71.4%). Opacities were mainly located in the peripheral (76.5%), subpleural (47.1%) zones of the lungs, and presented as focal (35.3%) or multifocal (29.4%) in the 1st week and became more diffuse in the 2nd (47.1%) and 3rd week (58.8%), then showed reduced extent in 4th week (50%). CONCLUSIONS: The progression course of CT pattern was later than the clinical parameters within the first two weeks since admission; however, there was a synchronized improvement in both clinical and radiologic features in the 4th week."],"journal":"Clin Infect Dis","authors":["Han, Xiaoyu","Cao, Yukun","Jiang, Nanchuan","Chen, Yan","Alwalid, Osamah","Zhang, Xin","Gu, Jin","Dai, Meng","Liu, Jie","Zhu, Wanyue","Zheng, Chuansheng","Shi, Heshui"],"date":"2020-04-01T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32227091","week":"202014|Mar 30 - Apr 05","doi":"10.1093/cid/ciaa271","keywords":["COVID-19","computed tomography","novel coronavirus pneumonia","viral pneumonia"],"source":"PubMed","topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1663352135288356866,"score":40.312542}]}
