Thousands of health workers have been infected and outbreaks have occurred in hospitals, aged care facilities and prisons.

The 1 - 2 m ( approximately 3 - 6 ft) rule of spatial separation is central to droplet precautions and assumes large droplets do not travel further than 2 m ( approximately 6 ft). We aimed to review the evidence for horizontal distance travelled by droplets and the guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), US Center for Diseases Control (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on respiratory protection for COVID-19. We found that the evidence base for current guidelines is sparse, and the available data do not support the 1 - 2 m ( approximately 3 - 6 ft) rule of spatial separation. Of ten studies on horizontal droplet distance, eight showed droplets travel more than 2 m ( approximately 6 ft), in some cases more than 8 meters ( approximately 26 ft). Several studies of SARS-CoV-2 support aerosol transmission and one study documented virus at a distance of 4 meters ( approximately 13 ft) from the patient. Moreover, evidence suggests infections cannot neatly be separated into the dichotomy of droplet versus airborne transmission routes.
