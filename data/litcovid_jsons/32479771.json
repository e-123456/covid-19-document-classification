DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Single academic medical center in New York City and Long Island. PARTICIPANTS: 5279 patients with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection between 1 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. The final date of follow up was 5 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were admission to hospital, critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice care, or death), and discharge to hospice care or death. Predictors included patient characteristics, medical history, vital signs, and laboratory results. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and competing risk survival analysis for mortality. RESULTS: Of 11 544 people tested for SARS-Cov-2, 5566 (48.2%) were positive. After exclusions, 5279 were included. 2741 of these 5279 (51.9%) were admitted to hospital, of whom 1904 (69.5%) were discharged alive without hospice care and 665 (24.3%) were discharged to hospice care or died. Of 647 (23.6%) patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 391 (60.4%) died and 170 (26.2%) were extubated or discharged. The strongest risk for hospital admission was associated with age, with an odds ratio of >2 for all age groups older than 44 years and 37.9 (95% confidence interval 26.1 to 56.0) for ages 75 years and older. Other risks were heart failure (4.4, 2.6 to 8.0), male sex (2.8, 2.4 to 3.2), chronic kidney disease (2.6, 1.9 to 3.6), and any increase in body mass index (BMI) (eg, for BMI >40: 2.5, 1.8 to 3.4). The strongest risks for critical illness besides age were associated with heart failure (1.9, 1.4 to 2.5), BMI >40 (1.5, 1.0 to 2.2), and male sex (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8). Admission oxygen saturation of <88% (3.7, 2.8 to 4.8), troponin level >1 (4.8, 2.1 to 10.9), C reactive protein level >200 (5.1, 2.8 to 9.2), and D-dimer level >2500 (3.9, 2.6 to 6.0) were, however, more strongly associated with critical illness than age or comorbidities. Risk of critical illness decreased significantly over the study period. Similar associations were found for mortality alone. CONCLUSIONS: Age and comorbidities were found to be strong predictors of hospital admission and to a lesser extent of critical illness and mortality in people with covid-19; however, impairment of oxygen on admission and markers of inflammation were most strongly associated with critical illness and mortality. Outcomes seem to be improving over time, potentially suggesting improvements in care.","BMJ","Petrilli, Christopher M","Jones, Simon A","Yang, Jie","Rajagopalan, Harish","O'Donnell, Luke","Chernyak, Yelena","Tobin, Katie A","Cerfolio, Robert J","Francois, Fritz","Horwitz, Leora I","32444366"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To describe outcomes of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in the United States, and the clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with severity of illness.

Other risks were heart failure (4.4, 2.6 to 8.0), male sex (2.8, 2.4 to 3.2), chronic kidney disease (2.6, 1.9 to 3.6), and any increase in body mass index (BMI) (eg, for BMI >40: 2.5, 1.8 to 3.4). The strongest risks for critical illness besides age were associated with heart failure (1.9, 1.4 to 2.5), BMI >40 (1.5, 1.0 to 2.2), and male sex (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8). Admission oxygen saturation of <88% (3.7, 2.8 to 4.8), troponin level >1 (4.8, 2.1 to 10.9), C reactive protein level >200 (5.1, 2.8 to 9.2), and D-dimer level >2500 (3.9, 2.6 to 6.0) were, however, more strongly associated with critical illness than age or comorbidities. Risk of critical illness decreased significantly over the study period. Similar associations were found for mortality alone. CONCLUSIONS: Age and comorbidities were found to be strong predictors of hospital admission and to a lesser extent of critical illness and mortality in people with covid-19; however, impairment of oxygen on admission and markers of inflammation were most strongly associated with critical illness and mortality. Outcomes seem to be improving over time, potentially suggesting improvements in care."],"journal":"BMJ","authors":["Petrilli, Christopher M","Jones, Simon A","Yang, Jie","Rajagopalan, Harish","O'Donnell, Luke","Chernyak, Yelena","Tobin, Katie A","Cerfolio, Robert J","Francois, Fritz","Horwitz, Leora I"],"date":"2020-05-24T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32444366","source":"PubMed","week":"202021|May 18 - May 24","doi":"10.1136/bmj.m1966","locations":["United States","New York","New York"],"countries":["United States"],"countries_codes":["USA|United States"],"topics":["Diagnosis","Treatment"],"weight":1,"_version_":1667600475866791936,"score":191.20976},{"pmid":32311790,"title":"Comparing rapid scoring systems in mortality prediction of critical ill patients with novel coronavirus disease.","text":["Comparing rapid scoring systems in mortality prediction of critical ill patients with novel coronavirus disease.","OBJECTIVES: Rapid and early severity-of-illness assessment appears to be important for critical ill patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the rapid scoring system on admission of these patients. METHODS: 138 medical records of critical ill patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics on admission used for calculating Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) and outcomes (survival or death) were collected for each case and extracted for analysis. All patients were divided into two age subgroups (<65 and >/=65years). The receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed for overall patients and both subgroups. RESULTS: The median [25%quartile, 75%quartile] of MEWS of survivors versus non-survivors were 1[1, 2] and 2[1, 3] and that of REMS were 5[2, 6] and 7[6, 10], respectively. In overall analysis, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the REMS in predicting mortality was 0.833 (95% CI: 0.737-0.928), higher than that of MEWS (0.677, 95% CI 0.541-0.813). An optimal cut-off of REMS (>/=6) had a sensitivity of 89.5%, a specificity of 69.8%, a positive predictive value of 39.5%, and a negative predictive value of 96.8%. In the analysis of subgroup of patients aged<65years, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the REMS in predicting mortality was 0.863 (95% CI: 0.743-0.941), higher than that of MEWS (0.603, 95% CI 0.462-0.732). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this study was the first exploration on rapid scoring systems for critical ill patients with COVID-19. The REMS could provide emergency clinicians with an effective adjunct risk stratification tool for critical ill patients with COVID-19, especially for the patients aged<65 years. The effectiveness of REMS for screening these patients is attributed to its high negative predictive value.","Acad Emerg Med","Hu, Hai","Yao, Ni","Qiu, Yanru","32311790"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVES: Rapid and early severity-of-illness assessment appears to be important for critical ill patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
