The mortality rate for critically ill patients is up to 60%, and thus, reducing the disease severity and case mortality is a top priority. Currently, cytokine storms are considered as the major cause of critical illness and death due to COVID-19. After systematical review of the literature, we propose that cross-reactive antibodies associated antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) may actually be the cause of cytokine storms. It would be more difficult to develop vaccines for highly pathogenic human coronaviruses if ADE characteristics are taken into consideration. Therefore, it is urgent to find an effective way to prevent the occurrence of severe illness as SARS-CoV-2 specific drugs or vaccines are still in development. If the activation of memory B cells can be selectively inhibited in high-risk patients at an early stage of COVID-19 to reduce the production of cross-reactive antibodies against the virus, we speculate that ADE can be circumvented and severe symptoms can be prevented. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors satisfy such needs and it is recommended to conduct clinical trials for mTOR inhibitors in preventing the severity of COVID-19.
