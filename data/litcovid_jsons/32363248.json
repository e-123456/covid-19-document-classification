Within our department, a multidisciplinary tracer team prospectively monitored all patients under investigation, tracking their test status, treatment delays, clinical outcomes, employee exposures and quarantines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective cohort tested for SARS-COV-2 infection over 35 consecutive days of the early pandemic (03/19/2020-04/22/2020). RESULTS: A total of 121 Radiation Oncology patients underwent RT-PCR testing during this timeframe. Of the 7 (6%) confirmed-positive cases, 6 patients were admitted (including 4 warranting intensive care), 2 of whom died from acute respiratory distress syndrome. Radiotherapy was deferred or interrupted for 40 patients awaiting testing. As the median turnaround time for RT-PCR testing decreased from 1.5 (IQR: 1-4) to </=1-day (P<0.001), the median treatment delay also decreased from 3.5 (IQR: 1.75-5) to 1 business day (IQR: 1-2) [P<0.001]. Each patient was an exposure risk to a median of 5 employees (IQR: 3-6.5) through prolonged close contact. During this timeframe, 39 care-team members were quarantined for a median of 3 days (IQR: 2-11), with a peak of 17 employees simultaneously quarantined. Following implementation of a \"dual PPE policy,\" newly quarantined employees decreased from 2.9 to 0.5 per day. CONCLUSION: The severe adverse events noted among these confirmed-positive cases support the notion that cancer patients are vulnerable to COVID-19. Active tracking, rapid diagnosis, and aggressive source control can mitigate the adverse effects on treatment delays, workforce incapacitation, and ideally outcomes.","Radiother Oncol","Ning, Matthew S","Frances McAleer, Mary","Jeter, Melenda D","Minsky, Bruce D","Ghafar, Robert A","Robinson, Ivy J","Nitsch, Paige L","Zaebst, Denise J","Todd, Sarah E","Nguyen, Jennifer","Lin, Steven H","Liao, Zhongxing","Lee, Percy","Brandon Gunn, G","Klopp, Ann H","Dabaja, Bouthaina S","Nguyen, Quynh-Nhu","Chronowski, Gregory M","Bloom, Elizabeth S","Koong, Albert C","Das, Prajnan","32474129"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic warrants operational initiatives to minimize transmission, particularly among cancer patients who are thought to be at high-risk.
