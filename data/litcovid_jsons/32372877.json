The airborne carrier for the COVID-19 can be tiny droplets and particulates from infected person, fine suspended mists (humidity) in air, or ambient aerosols in air. To-date, unfortunately there are no test standards for nano-aerosols (</=100 nm). A goal in our study is to develop air filters (e.g. respirator, facemask, ventilator, medical breathing filter/system) with 90% capture on 100-nm airborne COVID-19 with pressure drop of less than 30 Pa (3.1 mm water). There are two challenges. First, this airborne bio-nanoaerosol (combined virus and carrier) is amorphous unlike cubic NaCl crystals. Second, unlike standard laboratory tests on NaCl and test oil (DOP) droplets, these polydispersed aerosols all challenge the filter simultaneously and they are of different sizes and can interact among themselves complicating the filtration process. For the first time, we have studied these two effects using ambient aerosols (simulating the bio-nanoaerosols of coronavirus plus carrier of different shapes and sizes) to challenge electrostatically charged multilayer/multimodule nanofiber filters. This problem is fundamentally complicated due to mechanical and electrostatic interactions among aerosols of different sizes with induced charges of different magnitudes. The test filters were arranged in 2, 4, and 6 multiple-modules stack-up with each module having 0.765 g/m(2) of charged PVDF nanofibers (mean diameter 525 +/- 191 nm). This configuration minimized electrical interference among neighboring charged nanofibers and reduced flow resistance in the filter. For ambient aerosol size>80 nm (applicable to the smallest COVID-19), the electrostatic effect contributes 100-180% more efficiency to the existing mechanical efficiency (due to diffusion and interception) depending on the number of modules in the filter. By stacking-up modules to increase fiber basis weight in the filter, a 6-layer charged nanofiber filter achieved 88%, 88% and 96% filtration efficiency for, respectively, 55-nm, 100-nm and 300-nm ambient aerosol. This is very close to attaining our set goal of 90%-efficiency on the 100-nm ambient aerosol. The pressure drop for the 6-layer nanofiber filter was only 26 Pa (2.65 mm water column) which was below our limit of 30 Pa (3.1 mm water). For the test multi-module filters, a high 'quality factor' (efficiency-to-pressure-drop ratio) of about 0.1 to 0.13 Pa(-1) can be consistently maintained, which was far better than conventional filters. Using the same PVDF 6-layer charged nanofiber filter, laboratory tests results using monodispersed NaCl aerosols of 50, 100, and 300 nm yielded filtration efficiency, respectively, 92%, 94% and 98% (qualified for 'N98 standard') with same pressure drop of 26 Pa. The 2-6% discrepancy in efficiency for the NaCl aerosols was primarily attributed to the absence of interaction among aerosols of different sizes using monodispersed NaCl aerosols in the laboratory. This discrepancy can be further reduced with increasing number of modules in the filter and for larger 300-nm aerosol. The 6-layer charged nanofiber filter was qualified as a 'N98 respirator' (98% capture efficiency for 300-nm NaCl aerosols) but with pressure drop of only 2.65-mm water which was 1/10 below conventional N95 with 25-mm (exhaling) to 35-mm (inhaling) water column!

Within 3-1/2 months since outbreak in December 2019, over 1.3 million people have been infected across 206 countries with over 70,000 deaths. COVID-19 has a size of 60-140nm with mean size of the nano-aerosols, 100nm. The virus can be airborne by attaching to human secretion (fine particles, nasal/saliva droplets) of infected person or suspended fine particulates in air. While NIOSH has standardized N95 and N98 at 300nm, to-date there is no filter standards, nor special filter technologies, tailored for capturing airborne viruses and 100nm nano-aerosols. The latter also are present in high number concentration in atmospheric pollutants. This study addresses developing novel charged PVDF nanofiber filter technology to effectively capture the deadly airborne coronavirus with our target set at 100nm (nano-aerosol), and not 300nm. The virus and its attached particle were simulated by sodium chloride aerosols, 50-500nm, generated from sub-micron aerosol generator. PVDF nanofibers were produced with fiber diameters 84, 191, 349 and 525nm with excellent morphology. The fibers were subsequently charged by corona discharge. The amounts of charged fibers in a filter were increased to achieve high efficiency of 90% for the virus filter but the electrical interference between neighbouring fibers resulted in progressively marginal increase in efficiency and concurrently much higher pressure drop across the filter. The quality factor which measured the efficiency-to-pressure-drop kept decreasing. By redistributing the fibers in the filter into several modules, each separated by a permeable scrim material, the electrical interference was reduced, if not fully mitigated. Also, the additional scrim materials introduced macropores into the filter that further reduced the airflow resistance. With this approach, the quality factor can maintain relatively constant with increasing fiber amounts to achieve high filter efficiency. The optimal amounts of fiber in each module depended on the diameter of fibers in the module. Small fiber diameter that has already high performance required small amount of fibers per module. In contrast, large diameter fiber required more amounts of fiber per module to compensate for the poorer performance without incurring higher pressure drop. This approach was applied to develop four new nanofiber filters tailored for capturing 100nm airborne COVID-19 to achieve over 90% efficiency with pressure drop below 30Pa (3.1mm water). One filter developed meeting the 90% efficiency has ultralow pressure drop of only 18Pa (1.9mm water) while another filter meeting the 30Pa limit has high efficiency reaching 94%.
