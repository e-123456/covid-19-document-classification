To assess the presence of CoVs in bats, we performed identification and characterization of bat CoV (BtCoV) in P. medius and Rousettus species from representative States in India, collected during 2018 and 2019. Methods: : Representative rectal swab (RS) and throat swab specimens of Pteropus and Rousettus spp. bats were screened for CoVs using a pan-CoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. A single-step RT-PCR was performed on the RNA extracted from the bat specimens. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on a few representative bat specimens that were tested positive. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on the partial sequences of RdRp gene sequences retrieved from both the bat species and complete viral genomes recovered from Rousettus spp. Results: : Bat samples from the seven States were screened, and the RS specimens of eight Rousettus spp. and 21 Pteropus spp. were found positive for CoV RdRp gene.

Phylogenetic analysis of the partial RdRp region demonstrated distinct subclustering of the BtCoV sequences retrieved from these Rousettus and Pteropus spp. bats.

CONCLUSION: Cardiac injury is associated with mortality, need for ICU care, and severity of disease in patients with COVID-19."],"journal":"Am J Emerg Med","authors":["Santoso, Anwar","Pranata, Raymond","Wibowo, Arief","Al-Farabi, Makhyan Jibril","Huang, Ian","Antariksa, Budhi"],"date":"2020-04-26T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32331955","week":"202017|Apr 20 - Apr 26","doi":"10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.052","keywords":["covid-19","cardiac injury","coronavirus","mortality","troponin"],"source":"PubMed","topics":["Treatment"],"weight":1,"_version_":1665071049741434880,"score":187.12505}]}
