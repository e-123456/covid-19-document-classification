We aimed to assess the association between Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, and to compare the predictive ability of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and Confusion, Urea, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, Age 65 (CURB65) score. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort. SETTING: Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. SUBJECTS: Confirmed patients with coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalized in the ICU of Tongji hospital from January 10, 2020, to February 10, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 178 potentially eligible patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, 23 patients (12.92%) were diagnosed as suspected cases, and one patient (0.56%) suffered from cardiac arrest immediately after admission. Ultimately, 154 patients were enrolled in the analysis and 52 patients (33.77%) died. Mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (23.23 +/- 6.05) was much higher in deaths compared with the mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 10.87 +/- 4.40 in survivors (p < 0.001). Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was independently associated with hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01-1.13). In predicting hospital mortality, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score demonstrated better discriminative ability (area under the curve, 0.966; 95% CI, 0.942-0.990) than Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (area under the curve, 0.867; 95% CI, 0.808-0.926) and CURB65 score (area under the curve, 0.844; 95% CI, 0.784-0.905). Based on the cut-off value of 17, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score could predict the death of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with a sensitivity of 96.15% and a specificity of 86.27%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the survivor probability of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score less than 17 was notably higher than that of patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was an effective clinical tool to predict hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and CURB65 score. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 serves as an early warning indicator of death and may provide guidance to make further clinical decisions.","Crit Care Med","Zou, Xiaojing","Li, Shusheng","Fang, Minghao","Hu, Ming","Bian, Yi","Ling, Jianmin","Yu, Shanshan","Jing, Liang","Li, Donghui","Huang, Jiao","32371611"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 has emerged as a major global health threat with a great number of deaths in China.

The mean AUC in the development cohort was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.85-0.91) and the AUC in the validation cohort was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.93). The score has been translated into an online risk calculator that is freely available to the public (http://118.126.104.170/). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, a risk score based on characteristics of COVID-19 patients at the time of admission to the hospital was developed that may help predict a patient's risk of developing critical illness."],"journal":"JAMA Intern Med","authors":["Liang, Wenhua","Liang, Hengrui","Ou, Limin","Chen, Binfeng","Chen, Ailan","Li, Caichen","Li, Yimin","Guan, Weijie","Sang, Ling","Lu, Jiatao","Xu, Yuanda","Chen, Guoqiang","Guo, Haiyan","Guo, Jun","Chen, Zisheng","Zhao, Yi","Li, Shiyue","Zhang, Nuofu","Zhong, Nanshan","He, Jianxing"],"date":"2020-05-13T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32396163","source":"PubMed","week":"202020|May 11 - May 17","doi":"10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.2033","locations":["China","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Diagnosis","Treatment"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666627828016218113,"score":148.69084},{"pmid":32437939,"title":"Chest X-ray severity index as a predictor of in-hospital mortality in coronavirus disease 2019: A study of 302 patients from Italy.","text":["Chest X-ray severity index as a predictor of in-hospital mortality in coronavirus disease 2019: A study of 302 patients from Italy.","OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the usefulness of a new chest X-ray scoring system, the Brixia score, to predict the risk of in-hospital mortality in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) METHODS: Between March 4, 2020 and March 24, 2020, all CXR reports containing the Brixia score were retrieved. We enrolled only hospitalized Caucasian patients with COVID-19 for whom the final outcome was available. For each patient, age, sex, underlying comorbidities, immunosuppressive therapies and the CXR report containing the highest score were considered for the analysis. These independent variables were analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model to extract the predictive factors for in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 302 Caucasian patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 were enrolled. In the multivariable logistic regression model, only Brixia score, patient age, and conditions that induced immunosuppression were the significant predictive factors for in-hospital mortality. On receiver operating characteristic curve analyses, the optimal cutoff values for Brixia score and patient age were 8 points and 71 years, respectively. Three different models that included the Brixia score showed excellent predictive power.
