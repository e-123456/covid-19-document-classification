During an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 with community transmission, our institution utilized an integrated strategy for early detection and containment of COVID-19 amongst healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: Our institution utilized a strategy comprising three key components: enforcing reporting of HCWs with acute respiratory illness (ARI) to our institution's Staff Clinic for monitoring; conducting ongoing syndromic surveillance to obtain early warning of potential clusters of COVID-19, and outbreak investigation and management. RESULTS: Over a 16-week surveillance period, our institution detected 14 cases of COVID-19 amongst HCWs with ARI symptoms. 2 of the cases were linked epidemiologically and thus constituted a COVID-19 cluster with HCW-HCW transmission occurring intra-hospital; we also detected one family cluster and two clusters amongst HCWs who shared accommodation. Through early intervention, our institution contained all detected cases of COVID-19, with no onward transmission to HCWs or patients after containment measures were instituted. Early detection minimized the number of HCWs requiring quarantine, hence preserving business continuity during an ongoing pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: An integrated strategy of surveillance, outbreak management and encouraging individual responsibility was successful in detecting clusters of COVID-19 infection amongst HCWs early. With ongoing local transmission, vigilance must be maintained for intra-hospital spread in non-clinical areas, where social mingling of HCWs occurs.

Otolaryngologists and supporting health care workers (HCWs) are particularly at high risk of becoming infected while treating patients as many in-office procedures and surgeries are Aerosol Generating Medical Procedures (AGMP). Based on a review of the literature and various guidelines, recommendations are made to mitigate the risk to health care workers of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 while providing clinical care. RECOMMENDATIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic all elective and non-time sensitive Otolaryngology procedures should be deferred to mitigate the risk of transmission of infection to HCWs. For non-AGMPs in all patients, even COVID-19 positive patients Level 1 PPE (surgical mask, gown, gloves and face shield or goggles) is sufficient. If local prevalence is favourable and patients are asymptomatic and test negative for SARS-CoV-2, Level 1 PPE can be used during short duration AGMPs, with limited risk of infected aerosol spread. For AGMPs in patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a minimum of Level 2 PPE, with adequate protection of mucosal surfaces, is recommended (N95/FFP2 respirator, gown, double gloves, goggles or face shield and head cover). For long duration AGMPs that are deemed high-risk in COVID-19 positive patients, Level 3 PPE can provide a higher level of protection and be more comfortable during long duration surgeries if surgical hoods or PAPRs are used. It is recommended that these procedures are performed in negative pressure rooms, if available. It is essential to follow strict donning and doffing protocols to minimize the risk of contamination.
