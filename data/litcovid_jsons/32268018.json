METHODS: We collected the data of traditional Chinese medicine related to treatment plans published by the National and Provincial Health Committee and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine from the start of COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan to February 19, 2020. The frequency analysis, cluster analysis and correlation analysis were performed. RESULTS: The study collected 4 national and 34 regional prevention and treatment plans, 578 items, 84 traditional Chinese formulations, 60 Chinese patent medicines, and 230 Chinese herbs. The high frequently used herbs were Liquorice, Scutellariabaicalensis, Semen armeniacaeamarae, and Gypsum. The commonly used traditional formulations included Maxing Shigan Decoction, Yin Qiao Powder, and Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction. The Chinese patent drugs included Angong Niuhuang Pill, Xuebijing Injection, and Lianhua Qingwen Capsule. The most common paired medications were Ephedra and Semen armeniacaeamarae, Fructusforsythiae and Liquorice. Two core combinations and one novel formula were discovered in the study. CONCLUSIONS: Yin Qiao Powder and Huopo Xialing Decoction are the basic formulations for Weifen syndrome of COVID-19. In addition, Maxing Shigan Decoction, Liang Ge Powder, Qingwen Baidu Decoction and Da Yuan Decoction are the basic formulations for Qifen syndrome of COVID-19. The main medication characteristics are clearing heat, entilating lung, removing toxicity and removing turbidity. It shows that removing toxicity and eliminating evil are the prescription thought in treating epidemic disease of traditional Chinese medicine.","Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban","Fan, Tiantian","Chen, Yongcan","Bai, Yu","Ma, Fengqi","Wang, Hengcang","Yang, Yiping","Chen, Jinxu","Lin, Yuqi","32268018"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To analysis the medication characteristics of the prescriptions issued via open channel by the National and Provincial Health Committee and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine in treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS: There were two main steps in the screening process. In the first step we conducted a literature search for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Resulting compounds were cross-checked for listing in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database. Compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective. Next, a docking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-nCoV protein interaction. In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify plants containing the selected compounds. Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage.
