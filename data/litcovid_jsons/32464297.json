METHODS: This review sought to identify infection control practices measures during COVID-19 pandemic comes from our daily practice combined with the most recent guidelines with the new experience and information. RESULTS: Prevention the transmission of COVID-19 to the HCWs, four primary themes should be taken into consideration; (1) ongoing education and importance of the organization of the healthcare facility, (2) proper clinical triage and isolation of the suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in the outpatient clinics and in the emergency departments, (3) necessity of the organization of the COVID-19 wards, and (4) utilization of personal protective equipment.

As the epidemic has spread, similar cases have also been found in other parts of mainland China and abroad. The main reason for this spread is the highly contagious nature of the virus and the fact that children can also become infected during its incubation period. This has made the virus a substantial challenge for the outpatient triage staff of children's hospitals outside the epidemic area of the Hubei Province. It is very important for the preview and triage personnel to accurately grasp the epidemiology of the virus and identify children's symptoms in the fever clinic. Methods: We performed an analysis of our early preview and triage of suspected COVID-19 in 36 children presenting at fever clinics. Two specialists either excluded suspected cases or referred cases to the isolation ward for new nucleic acid testing. Results: All 14 children who were transferred to the isolation ward had a fever, and 71.43% of them had a cough. Their nucleic acid testing results were negative. The suspected cases and excluded suspected cases had similar epidemiology history as well as complete blood count results. With reference to the diagnostic criteria in existing pediatric guidelines, we have further improved the triage screening questionnaire for children with fever in our hospital. Conclusions: According to the situation in our city and hospital, an evaluation questionnaire that is suitable for use with children in our hospital has been formulated to achieve the goals of early detection, isolation, diagnosis, and treatment.

Being highly prevalent, the correct use of these masks is particularly important, as an incorrect use and disposal may actually increase the rate of transmission. The purpose of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practices of healthcare workers (HCWs) in wearing a surgical face mask to limit the spread of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Materials and Methods This survey was conducted by interviewing HCWs using a questionnaire consisting of the basic demographic characteristics, and the knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding the use of surgical face mask to limit the new COVID-19 exposure. Each correct answer was scored 1 and each incorrect answer scored 0. The total number of questions was 16, and the final score was calculated and then labeled according to the percentage (out of 16) of correct responses as good (>80%), moderate (60-80%), and poor (<60%). Results A total of 392 participants with a mean age of 42.37 +/- 13.34 years (341 males and 51 females) were included in the study.
