So far little is known about the role of an internet approach in COVID-19 surveillance. OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate whether an online survey can provide population-level information for observing prevalence trends during early phase of outbreak and identifying potential risk factors of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A 10-item online questionnaire was developed according to medical guidelines and relevant publications. It was distributed between 24 January and 17 February 2020. Characteristics of respondents and temporal changes of various questionnaire-derived indicators were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 18161 questionnaires were returned, including 6% (1171) from Wuhan City. Geographical distributions of the respondents were consistent with population per province (R(2) = 0.61, P < .001). History of contact significantly decreased with time, both outside Wuhan City (R(2) = 0.35, P = .002) and outside Hubei Province (R(2) = 0.42, P < .001). Percentage of fever respondents peaked around February 8 (R(2) = 0.57, P < .001) and increased with history of contact in the areas outside Wuhan City (risk ratio: 1.31, 95% confidence interval: 1.13 - 1.52, P < .001). Male sex, advanced age, and lung diseases were associated with a higher risk of fever in the general population with history of contact.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to apply rapid online surveying to determine knowledge and perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the general public in the United States and the United Kingdom. METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to 3000 adults residing in the United States and 3000 adults residing in the United Kingdom who had registered with Prolific Academic to participate in online research. Prolific Academic established strata by age (18-27, 28-37, 38-47, 48-57, or >/=58 years), sex (male or female), and ethnicity (white, black or African American, Asian or Asian Indian, mixed, or \"other\"), as well as all permutations of these strata. The number of participants who could enroll in each of these strata was calculated to reflect the distribution in the US and UK general population. Enrollment into the survey within each stratum was on a first-come, first-served basis. Participants completed the questionnaire between February 23 and March 2, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2986 and 2988 adults residing in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively, completed the questionnaire. Of those, 64.4% (1924/2986) of US participants and 51.5% (1540/2988) of UK participants had a tertiary education degree, 67.5% (2015/2986) of US participants had a total household income between US $20,000 and US $99,999, and 74.4% (2223/2988) of UK participants had a total household income between pound15,000 and pound74,999. US and UK participants' median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 5.0% (IQR 2.0%-15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR 2.0%-10.0%), respectively. Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of COVID-19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. For instance, 37.8% (95% CI 36.1%-39.6%) of US participants and 29.7% (95% CI 28.1%-31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was \"highly effective\" in protecting them from acquiring COVID-19, and 25.6% (95% CI 24.1%-27.2%) of US participants and 29.6% (95% CI 28.0%-31.3%) of UK participants thought it was prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. Around half (53.8%, 95% CI 52.1%-55.6%) of US participants and 39.1% (95% CI 37.4%-40.9%) of UK participants thought that children were at an especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).

Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P < .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P < .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19."],"journal":"JAMA Netw Open","authors":["Lai, Jianbo","Ma, Simeng","Wang, Ying","Cai, Zhongxiang","Hu, Jianbo","Wei, Ning","Wu, Jiang","Du, Hui","Chen, Tingting","Li, Ruiting","Tan, Huawei","Kang, Lijun","Yao, Lihua","Huang, Manli","Wang, Huafen","Wang, Gaohua","Liu, Zhongchun","Hu, Shaohua"],"date":"2020-03-24T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32202646","week":"202013|Mar 23 - Mar 29","doi":"10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.3976","link_comment_in":"32202641","source":"PubMed","weight":0,"locations":["China","China","Chinese","Wuhan","Wuhan","China","Wuhan","Hubei","Wuhan","Hubei","Hubei","Wuhan","Hubei","Hubei","Wuhan","Wuhan","China","Wuhan"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"_version_":1664639760431316992,"score":223.80423},{"pmid":32298802,"pmcid":"PMC7153528","title":"A longitudinal study on the mental health of general population during the COVID-19 epidemic in China.","text":["A longitudinal study on the mental health of general population during the COVID-19 epidemic in China.","In addition to being a public physical health emergency, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affected global mental health, as evidenced by panic-buying worldwide as cases soared.
