The sensitivity and specificity of screening criteria in detecting COVID-19 was assessed. A risk-stratified approach was adopted for PPE usage in the ED, based on high-risk \"fever areas\" and lower-risk zones. When a case of COVID-19 was confirmed, surveillance was conducted for potentially exposed patients and HCWs. RESULTS: A total of 1,841 cases presenting with respiratory syndromes required admission over the study period. Amongst these, 70 cases of COVID-19 were subsequently confirmed.

Given the broadened internal criteria, the pre-existing ED \"fever area\" was insufficient and had to be expanded.

During an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 with community transmission, our institution utilized an integrated strategy for early detection and containment of COVID-19 amongst healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: Our institution utilized a strategy comprising three key components: enforcing reporting of HCWs with acute respiratory illness (ARI) to our institution's Staff Clinic for monitoring; conducting ongoing syndromic surveillance to obtain early warning of potential clusters of COVID-19, and outbreak investigation and management. RESULTS: Over a 16-week surveillance period, our institution detected 14 cases of COVID-19 amongst HCWs with ARI symptoms. 2 of the cases were linked epidemiologically and thus constituted a COVID-19 cluster with HCW-HCW transmission occurring intra-hospital; we also detected one family cluster and two clusters amongst HCWs who shared accommodation. Through early intervention, our institution contained all detected cases of COVID-19, with no onward transmission to HCWs or patients after containment measures were instituted. Early detection minimized the number of HCWs requiring quarantine, hence preserving business continuity during an ongoing pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: An integrated strategy of surveillance, outbreak management and encouraging individual responsibility was successful in detecting clusters of COVID-19 infection amongst HCWs early. With ongoing local transmission, vigilance must be maintained for intra-hospital spread in non-clinical areas, where social mingling of HCWs occurs.
