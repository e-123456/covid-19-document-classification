Discontinuation of radiation treatments is not desirable and potentially life-threatening. On the other hand, accesses to hospital expose cancer patients to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. We report our extended protocol, draft to manage clinical activities in our radiotherapy department, by minimizing contagion risks. METHODS: We used telephonic screening to assess the need for patient admission. A telephonic triage was performed to identify the presence of COVID-19 infection risk factors or symptoms. New treatments were stratified according to priority codes. A reserved entrance to radiotherapy department was assured for patients and staff. Surgical disposable mask was required for patients and caregivers. The activities were distributed during the whole workday, avoiding overlap to reduce aggregation. RESULTS: From 1st February 2020 to 31 March 2020, we reported an increase in the number of first medical examinations and treatments, compared to the same period of the previous year. Outpatients first medical examinations have been spread over the 12 working hours. No COVID-19 cases were detected. CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 pandemic, we introduced procedures that allowed us to ensure the continuity in oncological cares, with limited risks of infection for patients and staff.","Radiol Med","Montesi, Giampaolo","Di Biase, Saide","Chierchini, Sara","Pavanato, Giovanni","Virdis, Graziella Elia","Contato, Edgardo","Mandoliti, Giovanni","32415473"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents a troubling health emergency but also a main challenge for the clinical governance of the system.
