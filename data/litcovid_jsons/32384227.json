METHODS: Retrospective cohort of 103 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Demographic data, past medical history and hospital course were collected and analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was implemented to examine associations. RESULTS: From February 17th to April 5th, 103 consecutive patients were hospitalized with COVID-19.

Moreover, patients who required IMV, were more likely to have had heart disease (aOR 3.41; 95% CI:1.05-11.06), obesity (BMI=30-34.9 kg/m2) (aOR 6.85; 95% CI: 1.05-44.82) or severe obesity (BMI>/=35 kg/m2) (aOR 9.99; 95% CI:1.39-71.69).
