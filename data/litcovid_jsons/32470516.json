OBJECTIVES: To examine longitudinal trends in hospitalizations for acute cardiovascular conditions across a tertiary care healthcare system. METHODS: We tracked acute cardiovascular hospitalizations between January 1(st), 2019 and March 31(st), 2020. We estimated daily hospitalization rates using negative binomial models. Temporal trends in hospitalization rates were compared across the first 3 months of 2020, with the first 3 months of 2019 as a reference. RESULTS: From January 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, 6,083 patients experienced 7,187 hospitalizations for primary acute cardiovascular reasons. There was 43.4% (27.4% to 56.0%) fewer estimated daily hospitalizations in March 2020 as compared with March 2019 (P<0.001). The daily rate of hospitalizations did not change throughout 2019 (-0.01% per day [-0.04% to +0.02%], P=0.50), January 2020 (-0.5% per day [-1.6% to +0.5%], P=0.31), or February 2020 (+0.7% per day [-0.6% to +2.0%], P=0.27). There was significant daily decline in hospitalizations in March 2020 (-5.9% per day [-7.6% to -4.3%], P<0.001).

OBJECTIVE: We examined, using an interrupted time series approach, whether the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been associated with a step change or increasing trend in UK downloads of an otherwise popular smoking cessation app, Smoke Free. METHODS: Data were from daily and non-daily adult smokers in the UK who had downloaded the Smoke Free app between 1 January 2020 and 31 March 2020 (primary analysis) and 1 January 2019 and 31 March 2020 (secondary analysis).
