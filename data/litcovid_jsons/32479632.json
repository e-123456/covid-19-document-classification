Chi-square and Wilcoxon two-sample tests to compare characteristics among hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases. RESULTS: During March 5-April 8, 2020, 6369 lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported to CDPH; 64 (1.0%) were among children 0-17 years. Ten patients (16%) were hospitalized, seven (70%) required intensive care (ICU); median length of hospitalization 4 days (range: 1-14). Reported fever and dyspnea were significantly higher in hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients (9/10 vs. 28/54, p = 0.04 and 7/10 vs. 10/54, p = 0.002, respectively). Hospitalized patients were significantly younger than non-hospitalized patients (median, 3.5 years vs. 12 years; p = 0.03) and all either had an underlying comorbidity or co-infection. Among the 34 unique households with multiple laboratory-confirmed infections, median number of laboratory-confirmed infections was 2 (range: 2-5), and 31 (91%) households had at least one COVID-19 infected adult.

Information about the clinical characteristics of infected patients who require intensive care is limited. Objective: To characterize patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requiring treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) in the Lombardy region of Italy. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective case series of 1591 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 referred for ICU admission to the coordinator center (Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy) of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network and treated at one of the ICUs of the 72 hospitals in this network between February 20 and March 18, 2020. Date of final follow-up was March 25, 2020. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swabs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic and clinical data were collected, including data on clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality. Data were recorded by the coordinator center on an electronic worksheet during telephone calls by the staff of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network. Results: Of the 1591 patients included in the study, the median (IQR) age was 63 (56-70) years and 1304 (82%) were male. Of the 1043 patients with available data, 709 (68%) had at least 1 comorbidity and 509 (49%) had hypertension. Among 1300 patients with available respiratory support data, 1287 (99% [95% CI, 98%-99%]) needed respiratory support, including 1150 (88% [95% CI, 87%-90%]) who received mechanical ventilation and 137 (11% [95% CI, 9%-12%]) who received noninvasive ventilation. The median positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 14 (IQR, 12-16) cm H2O, and Fio2 was greater than 50% in 89% of patients. The median Pao2/Fio2 was 160 (IQR, 114-220). The median PEEP level was not different between younger patients (n = 503 aged </=63 years) and older patients (n = 514 aged >/=64 years) (14 [IQR, 12-15] vs 14 [IQR, 12-16] cm H2O, respectively; median difference, 0 [95% CI, 0-0]; P = .94). Median Fio2 was lower in younger patients: 60% (IQR, 50%-80%) vs 70% (IQR, 50%-80%) (median difference, -10% [95% CI, -14% to 6%]; P = .006), and median Pao2/Fio2 was higher in younger patients: 163.5 (IQR, 120-230) vs 156 (IQR, 110-205) (median difference, 7 [95% CI, -8 to 22]; P = .02). Patients with hypertension (n = 509) were older than those without hypertension (n = 526) (median [IQR] age, 66 years [60-72] vs 62 years [54-68]; P < .001) and had lower Pao2/Fio2 (median [IQR], 146 [105-214] vs 173 [120-222]; median difference, -27 [95% CI, -42 to -12]; P = .005). Among the 1581 patients with ICU disposition data available as of March 25, 2020, 920 patients (58% [95% CI, 56%-61%]) were still in the ICU, 256 (16% [95% CI, 14%-18%]) were discharged from the ICU, and 405 (26% [95% CI, 23%-28%]) had died in the ICU.

Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICUs in Lombardy, Italy, the majority were older men, a large proportion required mechanical ventilation and high levels of PEEP, and ICU mortality was 26%."],"journal":"JAMA","authors":["Grasselli, Giacomo","Zangrillo, Alberto","Zanella, Alberto","Antonelli, Massimo","Cabrini, Luca","Castelli, Antonio","Cereda, Danilo","Coluccello, Antonio","Foti, Giuseppe","Fumagalli, Roberto","Iotti, Giorgio","Latronico, Nicola","Lorini, Luca","Merler, Stefano","Natalini, Giuseppe","Piatti, Alessandra","Ranieri, Marco Vito","Scandroglio, Anna Mara","Storti, Enrico","Cecconi, Maurizio","Pesenti, Antonio","Nailescu, Adriana","Corona, Alberto","Zangrillo, Alberto","Protti, Alessandro","Albertin, Andrea","Forastieri Molinari, Andrea","Lombardo, Andrea","Pezzi, Angelo","Benini, Annalisa","Scandroglio, Anna Mara","Malara, Annalisa","Castelli, Antonio","Coluccello, Antonio","Micucci, Antonio","Pesenti, Antonio","Sala, Antonello","Alborghetti, Armando","Antonini, Benvenuto","Capra, Carlo","Troiano, Carmine","Roscitano, Claudio","Radrizzani, Danilo","Chiumello, Davide","Coppini, Davide","Guzzon, Davide","Costantini, Elena","Malpetti, Elena","Zoia, Elena","Catena, Emanuele","Agosteo, Emiliano","Barbara, Enrico","Beretta, Enrico","Boselli, Enrico","Storti, Enrico","Harizay, Fabiola","Della Mura, Federica","Lorini, Ferdinando Luca","Donato Sigurta, Francesco","Marino, Francesco","Mojoli, Francesco","Rasulo, Frank","Grasselli, Giacomo","Casella, Giampaolo","De Filippi, Gianluca","Castelli, Gianpaolo","Aldegheri, Giorgio","Gallioli, Giorgio","Lotti, Giorgio","Albano, Giovanni","Landoni, Giovanni","Marino, Giovanni","Vitale, Giovanni","Battista Perego, Giovanni","Evasi, Giulia","Citerio, Giuseppe","Foti, Giuseppe","Natalini, Giuseppe","Merli, Guido","Sforzini, Ilaria","Bianciardi, Leonardo","Carnevale, Livio","Grazioli, Lorenzo","Cabrini, Luca","Guatteri, Luca","Salvi, Luca","Dei Poli, Marco","Galletti, Marco","Gemma, Marco","Ranucci, Marco","Riccio, Mario","Borelli, Massimo","Zambon, Massimo","Subert, Matteo","Cecconi, Maurizio","Mazzoni, Maurizio Giovanni","Raimondi, Maurizio","Panigada, Mauro","Belliato, Mirko","Bronzini, Nicola","Latronico, Nicola","Petrucci, Nicola","Belgiorno, Nicolangela","Tagliabue, Paola","Cortellazzi, Paolo","Gnesin, Paolo","Grosso, Paolo","Gritti, Paolo","Perazzo, Paolo","Severgnini, Paolo","Ruggeri, Patrizia","Sebastiano, Pietro","Covello, Remo Daniel","Fernandez-Olmos, Raquel","Fumagalli, Roberto","Keim, Roberto","Rona, Roberto","Valsecchi, Roberto","Cattaneo, Sergio","Colombo, Sergio","Cirri, Silvia","Bonazzi, Stefano","Greco, Stefano","Muttini, Stefano","Langer, Thomas","Alaimo, Valentina","Viola, Uberto"],"date":"2020-04-07T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32250385","source":"PubMed","week":"202015|Apr 06 - Apr 12","doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.5394","locations":["China","Italy","Milan","Italy","Lombardy","Italy","Lombardy","Italy"],"countries":["Italy","China"],"countries_codes":["ITA|Italy","CHN|China"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138490975289344,"score":216.81819},{"pmid":32031570,"pmcid":"PMC7042881","title":"Clinical Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patients With 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, China.","text":["Clinical Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patients With 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, China.","Importance: In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. Objective: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. Exposures: Documented NCIP. Main Outcomes and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. Results: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 x 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation).
