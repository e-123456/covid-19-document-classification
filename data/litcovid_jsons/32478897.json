These cells usually have abnormalities from the original tumor itself, but may also develop abnormalities due to genetic manipulation, or genetic and epigenetic changes during long term passages. Primary cultures may maintain lineage functions as the original tissue types, yet they have a very limited life span or population doubling time because of the nature of cellular senescence. Primary cultures usually have very low yields, and the high variability from any original tissue specimens, largely limiting their applications in research. Animal models are often used for studies of virus infections, disease modeling, development of antiviral drugs and vaccines. Human viruses often need a series of passages in vivo in order to adapt to the host environment because of variable receptors on the cell surface and may have intracellular restrictions from the cell types or host species.
