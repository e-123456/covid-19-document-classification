This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of liver blood tests in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The analysis included clinical data of 23 patients with suspected COVID-19 and 66 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from January 25 to February 20, 2020. The relationship between liver blood test results, liver condition (HBsAb positive, HBcAb positive, and fatty liver disease), and duration of hospital stay among COVID-19 patients was analyzed. RESULTS: The median hospital stay of COVID-19 patients was 6 days. Serum albumin (Alb) level was lower in patients with COVID-19 confirmed on admission than in patients with suspected COVID-19 (40.08 g/L vs 42.50 g/L, P = .016), while the level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was higher (23 U/L vs 18 U/L, P = .005). Abnormal results of liver blood tests in patients with COVID-19 included increased levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) (21.2%, 14 patients), AST (15.2%, 10 patients), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) (22.7%, 15 patients). After 5-10 days of treatment, levels of Alb and AST in COVID-19 patients were significantly decreased (P < .001 and P = .027, respectively). Abnormal levels of Alb and AST in patients with COVID-19 were not associated with the liver condition (all P > .05). In addition, only levels of AST were positively correlated with the duration of hospital stay (r = .334, P = .007). CONCLUSION: Abnormal results of the liver blood test were found in COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 patients on admission with the higher levels of AST might have longer hospital stays.","J Clin Lab Anal","Gu, Xuexiang","Li, Xiangyu","An, Xusheng","Yang, Shufeng","Wu, Shangnong","Yang, Xiaozhong","Wang, Honggang","32488888"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide public health emergency.

To pool data, a fixed- or random-effects model was used depending on the heterogeneity between studies. Furthermore, publication bias test and sensitivity analysis were also done. RESULTS: In total, 20 retrospective studies with 3,428 COVID-19 infected patients (severe cases = 1,455 and mild cases = 1,973), were included in this meta-analysis. Higher serum levels of Aspartate aminotransferase (weighted mean difference = 8.84 U/L, 95% CI = 5.97 to 11.71, P<0.001), Alanine aminotransferase (weighted mean difference = 7.35 U/L, 95% CI = 4.77 to 9.93, P<0.001), total Bilirubin (weighted mean difference = 2.30 mmol/L, 95% CI = 1.24 to 3.36, P<0.001) and lower serum levels of Albumin (weighted mean difference = -4.24 g/L, 95% CI = -6.20 to -2.28, P<0.001), were associated with a significant increase in the severity of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of liver injury, as assessed by serum analysis (AST, ALT, total Bilirubin and Albumin levels), seems to be higher in patients with severe COVID-19 infection."],"journal":"Hepatol Res","authors":["Parohan, Mohammad","Yaghoubi, Sajad","Seraj, Asal"],"date":"2020-05-10T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32386449","source":"PubMed","week":"202019|May 04 - May 10","doi":"10.1111/hepr.13510","keywords":["covid-19","meta-analysis","sars-cov-2","liver","novel coronavirus"],"topics":["Diagnosis","Treatment"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666340102067978240,"score":271.63358}]}
