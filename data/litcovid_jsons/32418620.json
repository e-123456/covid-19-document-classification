There is controversy regarding risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. It has been suggested that asthma and allergy are not highly represented as co-morbid conditions associated with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To extend our work in interleukin (IL)-13 biology to determine if airway epithelial cell expression of two key mediators critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) are modulated by IL-13. METHODS: We determined effects of IL-13 treatment on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression ex vivo in primary airway epithelial cells from participants with and without type 2 asthma obtained by bronchoscopy. We also examined expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in two datasets containing gene expression data from nasal and airway epithelial cells from children and adults with asthma and allergic rhinitis. RESULTS: IL-13 significantly reduced ACE2 and increased TMPRSS2 expression ex vivo in airway epithelial cells. In two independent datasets, ACE2 expression was significantly reduced and TMPRSS2 was significantly increased in the nasal and airway epithelial cells in type 2 asthma and allergic rhinitis. ACE2 expression was significantly negatively associated with type 2 cytokines while TMPRSS2 expression was significantly positively associated with type 2 cytokines. CONCLUSION: IL-13 modulates ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in airway epithelial cells in asthma.

METHODS: Human conjunctiva and primary pterygium tissues were collected from pterygium patients who underwent surgery. The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes was determined in human primary conjunctival and pterygium cells, human ocular and other tissue cell lines, mesenchymal stem cells as well as mouse ocular and other tissues by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and SYBR green PCR. RESULTS: RT-PCR analysis showed consistent expression by 2 ACE2 gene primers in 2 out of 3 human conjunctival cells and pterygium cell lines.
