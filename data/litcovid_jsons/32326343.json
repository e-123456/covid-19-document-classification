Nanostructured TiO2 is a promising candidate for the passive reduction of transmission when applied to handles, push-plates and switches in hospitals.

This nanoplate thickness is key to achieving the large aspect ratio of surface area to migration path length. TiO2 solid coatings were prepared by pulsed-pressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (pp-MOCVD) under the same deposition temperature and mass flux, with thickness ranging from 1.3-16 mm, by varying the number of precursor pulses. SEM and STEM were used to measure the mille-feuille plate width which is believed to be a key functional nano-dimension for photocatalytic activity. Competitive growth produces a larger columnar crystal diameter with thickness. The question is if the nano-dimension also increases with columnar crystal size. We report that the nano-dimension increases with the film thickness, ranging from 17-42 nm.
