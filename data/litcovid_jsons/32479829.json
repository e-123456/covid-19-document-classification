This study reports 30-day mortality and pulmonary complication rates in patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This international, multicentre, cohort study at 235 hospitals in 24 countries included all patients undergoing surgery who had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed within 7 days before or 30 days after surgery. The primary outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality and was assessed in all enrolled patients. The main secondary outcome measure was pulmonary complications, defined as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or unexpected postoperative ventilation. FINDINGS: This analysis includes 1128 patients who had surgery between Jan 1 and March 31, 2020, of whom 835 (74.0%) had emergency surgery and 280 (24.8%) had elective surgery. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed preoperatively in 294 (26.1%) patients. 30-day mortality was 23.8% (268 of 1128). Pulmonary complications occurred in 577 (51.2%) of 1128 patients; 30-day mortality in these patients was 38.0% (219 of 577), accounting for 82.6% (219 of 265) of all deaths. In adjusted analyses, 30-day mortality was associated with male sex (odds ratio 1.75 [95% CI 1.28-2.40], p<0.0001), age 70 years or older versus younger than 70 years (2.30 [1.65-3.22], p<0.0001), American Society of Anesthesiologists grades 3-5 versus grades 1-2 (2.35 [1.57-3.53], p<0.0001), malignant versus benign or obstetric diagnosis (1.55 [1.01-2.39], p=0.046), emergency versus elective surgery (1.67 [1.06-2.63], p=0.026), and major versus minor surgery (1.52 [1.01-2.31], p=0.047). INTERPRETATION: Postoperative pulmonary complications occur in half of patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection and are associated with high mortality. Thresholds for surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic should be higher than during normal practice, particularly in men aged 70 years and older. Consideration should be given for postponing non-urgent procedures and promoting non-operative treatment to delay or avoid the need for surgery.

Here we characterise the outcomes of a cohort of patients with cancer and COVID-19 and identify potential prognostic factors for mortality and severe illness. METHODS: In this cohort study, we collected de-identified data on patients with active or previous malignancy, aged 18 years and older, with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection from the USA, Canada, and Spain from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) database for whom baseline data were added between March 17 and April 16, 2020. We collected data on baseline clinical conditions, medications, cancer diagnosis and treatment, and COVID-19 disease course. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality within 30 days of diagnosis of COVID-19. We assessed the association between the outcome and potential prognostic variables using logistic regression analyses, partially adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and obesity. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04354701, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Of 1035 records entered into the CCC19 database during the study period, 928 patients met inclusion criteria for our analysis. Median age was 66 years (IQR 57-76), 279 (30%) were aged 75 years or older, and 468 (50%) patients were male. The most prevalent malignancies were breast (191 [21%]) and prostate (152 [16%]). 366 (39%) patients were on active anticancer treatment, and 396 (43%) had active (measurable) cancer. At analysis (May 7, 2020), 121 (13%) patients had died. In logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with increased 30-day mortality, after partial adjustment, were: increased age (per 10 years; partially adjusted odds ratio 1.84, 95% CI 1.53-2.21), male sex (1.63, 1.07-2.48), smoking status (former smoker vs never smoked: 1.60, 1.03-2.47), number of comorbidities (two vs none: 4.50, 1.33-15.28), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or higher (status of 2 vs 0 or 1: 3.89, 2.11-7.18), active cancer (progressing vs remission: 5.20, 2.77-9.77), and receipt of azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine (vs treatment with neither: 2.93, 1.79-4.79; confounding by indication cannot be excluded). Compared with residence in the US-Northeast, residence in Canada (0.24, 0.07-0.84) or the US-Midwest (0.50, 0.28-0.90) were associated with decreased 30-day all-cause mortality. Race and ethnicity, obesity status, cancer type, type of anticancer therapy, and recent surgery were not associated with mortality.

DIAGNOSES AND INTERVENTIONS: The patient's postoperative pathological diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lung. On the fourth day after the operation, the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test showed a positive result. After the operation, we routinely give symptomatic treatments such as anti-infection, nebulization and oxygen inhalation.

However, there have been no reported cases of pulmonary lobectomy with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) infection. We are the first to report such a case. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a 63-year-old Wuhan male patient with smoking history of 40 cigarettes per day for 40 years. He sought medical consultation for right lower lung nodules found by CT scan. DIAGNOSES AND INTERVENTIONS: The patient's postoperative pathological diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lung. On the fourth day after the operation, the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test showed a positive result. After the operation, we routinely give symptomatic treatments such as anti-infection, nebulization and oxygen inhalation. We also change antibiotics several times depending on the patient's condition. OUTCOMES: The patient's condition continued to deteriorate. On the fifth day after surgery, the patient died despite medical treatment. LESSONS: We are the first to report the diagnosis and treatment process of patients with COVID-19 during perioperative period of lobectomy. It provides a case for the postoperative management of such patients."],"journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","authors":["Han, Peng","Li, Fan","Cao, Peng","Hu, Shan","Kong, Kangle","Deng, Yu","Zu, Yukun","Zhao, Bo"],"date":"2020-06-03T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32481381","source":"PubMed","week":"202023|Jun 01 - Jun 07","doi":"10.1097/MD.0000000000020166","locations":["Wuhan"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Case Report"],"weight":1,"_version_":1668704334454456321,"score":248.61638}]}
