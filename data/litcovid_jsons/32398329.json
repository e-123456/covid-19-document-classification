We aimed to delineate the differences in viral dynamics and clinical features between them and tried to focus on every basic details of SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) that every health care provider must know. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed database up till April 2, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV that dealt with viral dynamics. RESULTS: Ample data is available to suggest the differences in etiology, transmission cycle, diagnosis, genetics, hosts, reproductive rates, clinical features, laboratory diagnosis and radiological features between SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Although SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is more infectious than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, most infections are generally mild and self-limiting.
