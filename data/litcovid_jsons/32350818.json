OBJECTIVE: To assess the degree of chloroquine-induced QTc prolongation in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and ECGs recorded during chloroquine treatment were retrospectively collected in patients suspected of having COVID-19. The QTc interval was calculated by computerised and manual interpretation. Baseline and follow-up QTc intervals were compared using the paired samples t-test. RESULTS: A total of 95 patients had a baseline ECG recording and at least one ECG recording during chloroquine therapy. Chloroquine treatment resulted in a mean QTc prolongation of 35ms (95% CI 28-43ms) using computerised interpretation and 34ms (95% CI 25-43ms) using manual interpretation. No torsade de pointes was observed during chloroquine treatment. After manual review, 22 patients (23%) had a QTc interval exceeding 500ms during chloroquine treatment. None of these patients had a prolonged QTc interval prior to the initiation of chloroquine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Chloroquine significantly prolongs the QTc interval in a clinically relevant matter.
