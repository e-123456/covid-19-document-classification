This study aims to investigate the clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with viral shedding in children with mild COVID-19. METHODS: The clinical and laboratory information of 110 children with COVID-19 at Wuhan Children's Hospital, Wuhan, China, from January 30 to March 10, 2020, were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The median age was 6 years old. The median period of viral shedding of COVID-19 was 15 days (interquartile range [IQR], 11-20 days) as measured from illness onset to discharge.
