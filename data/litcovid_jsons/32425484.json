METHODS: Medline was systematically searched using PubMed (search date March 19, 2020) for relevant studies in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Documented practices and guidance were assessed to determine Oxford levels of evidence (OLE), and recommendations for practice within five domains were extracted: physical OR, personnel, patient, procedure, and other factors. RESULTS: Thirty-five articles were identified, of which 11 met eligibility criteria. Nine articles constituted expert opinion and two were retrospective studies. All articles originated from the Far East (China nine, Singapore two); eight of the articles concerned general surgery. Common themes were identified within each domain, but all recommendations were based on low levels of evidence, median OLE 5 (range 4 - 5). The highest number of overlapping recommendations related to physical OR (n=8) and procedural factors (n=13).
