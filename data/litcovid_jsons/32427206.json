METHODS: The CRISP-DM (CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) standardized methodology for knowledge mining from database structures was chosen for the complex solution of analytical processing and visualization of data, which provides validated information on the COVID-19 epidemic across the Czech Republic.
