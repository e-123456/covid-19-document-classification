However, not only the effectiveness of HCQ has remained questionable, and mainly based on pre-clinical, and a few small clinical studies, but also HCQ is known to be potentially arrhythmogenic, especially as a result of QT prolongation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the arrhythmic effects of HCQ as the heightened risk is especially relevant as COVID-19 patients are at a higher risk of cardiac complications and arrhythmias at baseline. METHODS: Here, we use the optical mapping technique, using voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes, to illustrate the arrhythmic effects of hydroxychloroquine in ex-vivo guinea pig and rabbit hearts perfused with the upper therapeutic serum doses of HCQ (up to 1000ng/ml). RESULTS: We observe that HCQ markedly increases the action potential dispersion and results in the development of repolarization alternans and initiate polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.
