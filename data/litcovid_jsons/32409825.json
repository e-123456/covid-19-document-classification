METHODS: We acquired information and data on the general information, infection and death status of health care workers in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak and completed statistical analyses. RESULTS: We have obtained the data on 2,457 infected cases among health care workers in Wuhan, China. More than half of the infected individuals were nurses (52.06%), while 33.62% of infected cases were doctors and 14.33% of cases were medical staff. In particular, the case infection rate of nurses (2.22%) was remarkably higher than that of doctors (1.92%). Most infected cases among health care workers were female (72.28%).

Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible.
