It poses an extraordinary challenge for public health systems, because screening and surveillance capacity-especially during the beginning of the outbreak-is often severely limited, fueling the outbreak as many patients unknowingly infect others. OBJECTIVE: We present an effort to collect and analyze COVID-19 related posts on the popular Twitter-like social media site in China, Weibo. To our knowledge, this infoveillance study employs the largest, most comprehensive and fine-grained social media data to date to predict COVID-19 case counts in mainland China. METHODS: We built a Weibo user pool of 250 million, approximately half of the entire monthly active Weibo user population. Using a comprehensive list of 167 keywords, we retrieved and analyzed around 15 million COVID-19 related posts from our user pool, from November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020. We developed a machine learning classifier to identify \"sick posts,\" which are reports of one's own and other people's symptoms and diagnosis related to COVID-19. Using officially reported case counts as the outcome, we then estimated the Granger causality of sick posts and other COVID-19 posts on daily case counts. For a subset of geotagged posts (3.10% of all retrieved posts), we also ran separate predictive models for Hubei province, the epicenter of the initial outbreak, and the rest of mainland China. RESULTS: We found that reports of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 significantly predicted daily case counts, up to 14 days ahead of official statistics, whereas other COVID-19 posts did not have similar predictive power. For the subset of geotagged posts, we found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China, regardless of unequal distribution of healthcare resources and outbreak timeline. CONCLUSIONS: Public social media data can be usefully harnessed to predict infection cases and inform timely responses. Researchers and disease control agencies should pay close attention to the social media infosphere regarding COVID-19. On top of monitoring overall search and posting activities, leveraging machine learning approaches and theoretical understandings of information sharing behaviors is a promising approach to identifying true disease signals and improving the effectiveness of infoveillance.

Infoveillance approaches using social media can help characterize disease distribution and public knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors critical to the early stages of an outbreak. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to conduct a quantitative and qualitative assessment of Chinese social media posts originating in Wuhan City on the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Chinese-language messages from Wuhan were collected for 39 days between December 23, 2019, and January 30, 2020, on Weibo. For quantitative analysis, the total daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan were obtained from the Chinese National Health Commission, and a linear regression model was used to determine if Weibo COVID-19 posts were predictive of the number of cases reported. Qualitative content analysis and an inductive manual coding approach were used to identify parent classifications of news and user-generated COVID-19 topics. RESULTS: A total of 115,299 Weibo posts were collected during the study time frame consisting of an average of 2956 posts per day (minimum 0, maximum 13,587). Quantitative analysis found a positive correlation between the number of Weibo posts and the number of reported cases from Wuhan, with approximately 10 more COVID-19 cases per 40 social media posts (P<.001). This effect size was also larger than what was observed for the rest of China excluding Hubei Province (where Wuhan is the capital city) and held when comparing the number of Weibo posts to the incidence proportion of cases in Hubei Province. Qualitative analysis of 11,893 posts during the first 21 days of the study period with COVID-19-related posts uncovered four parent classifications including Weibo discussions about the causative agent of the disease, changing epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak, public reaction to outbreak control and response measures, and other topics. Generally, these themes also exhibited public uncertainty and changing knowledge and attitudes about COVID-19, including posts exhibiting both protective and higher-risk behaviors.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined public engagement and government responsiveness in the communications about COVID-19 during the early epidemic stage based on analysis of data from Sina Weibo, a major social media platform in China. METHODS: Weibo data relevant to COVID-19 from December 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020 were retrieved. Engagement data (Likes, Comments, Shares and Followers) of posts from government agency accounts were extracted to evaluate public engagement with government posts online. Content analyses were conducted for a random subset of 644 posts from personal accounts of individuals, and 273 posts from 10 relatively more active government agency accounts and the National Health Commission of China to identify major thematic contents in online discussions. Latent class analysis (LCA) was employed to further explore main content patterns while Chi-square for trend examined how proportions of main content patterns changed by time within the study timeframe. RESULTS: Public response to COVID-19 seemed to follow the spread of the disease and government actions but was earlier on Weibo than the government. Online users generally had low engagement with posts relevant COVID-19 from government agency accounts. The common content patterns identified in personal and government posts included sharing epidemic situation, general knowledge of the new disease, and policies, guidelines and official actions. However, personal posts more likely showed empathy to affected people (chi-square=13.3, P<.001), attributed blame to other individuals or government (chi-square=28.9, P<.001), and expressed worry about the epidemic (chi-square=32.1, P<.001) while government posts more likely shared instrumental support (chi-square=32.5, P<.001) and praised people or organizations (chi-square=8.7, P=.003). As the epidemic evolved, sharing situation update (chi-square for trend=19.7, P<.001), and policies, guidelines and official actions (chi-square for trend=15.3, P<.001) became less frequent in personal posts but remained stable or increased significantly in government posts.

Importantly, the pandemic is historic in scope and precedent given its emergence in an increasing digital era. Importantly, there have been concerns about the accuracy of COVID-19 case counts due to issues such as lack of access to testing and difficulty in measuring recoveries. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to detect and characterize user-generated conversations that could be associated with COVID-19-related symptoms, experiences with access to testing, and mentions of disease recovery using an unsupervised machine learning approach. METHODS: Tweets were collected from the Twitter public streaming API from March 3-20, 2020, filtered for general COVID-19-related keywords and then further filtered for terms that could be related to COVID-19 symptoms as self-reported by users. Tweets were analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning approach called the biterm topic model (BTM), where groups of tweets containing the same word-related themes were separated into topic clusters that included conversations about symptoms, testing, and recovery. Tweets in these clusters were then extracted and manually annotated for content analysis and also assessed for their statistical and geographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 4,492,954 tweets were collected that contained terms that could be related to COVID-19 symptoms. After using BTM to identify relevant topic clusters and removing duplicate tweets, we identified a total of 3,465 (<1%) tweets that included user generated conversations about experiences that users associated with possible COVID-19 symptoms and other disease experiences. These tweets were grouped into five main categories including first and second-hand reports of symptoms, symptom reporting concurrent with lack of testing, discussion of recovery, confirmation of negative COVID-19 diagnosis after receiving testing, and users recalling symptoms and questioning whether they might have been previously infected with COVID-19. Co-occurrence of tweets for these themes were statistically significant for users reporting symptoms with lack of testing and with discussion of recovery. Sixty-three percent (n=1112) of tweets were located in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: This study used unsupervised machine learning for the purposes of characterizing self-reporting of symptoms, experiences with testing, and mentions of recovery related to COVID-19. Many users reported symptoms they thought were related to COVID-19, but also were not able to get tested to confirm their concerns. In the absence of testing availability and confirmation, accurate case estimations for this period of the outbreak may never be known.

In the absence of testing availability and confirmation, accurate case estimations for this period of the outbreak may never be known. Future studies should continue to explore the utility of infoveillance approaches to estimate COVID-19 disease severity.
