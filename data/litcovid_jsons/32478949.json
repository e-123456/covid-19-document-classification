Two corresponding periods of 2019 and 2020 were compared in aspect of number of hospitalizations, sex and age profile of inpatients. We clearly showed a significant reduction of hospitalized patients during the pandemic period, with marked reduction of female patients. Moreover, the significant decrease of admissions to dermatology ward was observed within children and patients older than 70 years. Patients with chronic inflammatory dermatoses (eg, atopic dermatitis, eczemas, lichen planus, pityriasis rubra pilaris) were less often hospitalized during the pandemic period. In contrast, patients suffering from dermatitis due to substances taken internally, erysipelas, syphilis and primary cutaneous lymphomas constituted significantly higher rate of hospitalized subjects in 2020 year.

To date, there are no data in the literature on the comorbid dermatologic diseases and COVID-19. We tried to analyze the previous dermatological comorbidity of 93 patients with COVID-19 (51 males, 42 females) who presented to the dermatology outpatient clinics for the last 3 years. The most common dermatologic diseases in patients with COVID-19 who have dermatologic diseases for the last three years were superficial fungal infections (24, 25.8%), seborrheic dermatitis (11, 11.8%), actinic keratosis (10, 10.8%), psoriasis (6, 6.5%) and eczema (6, 6.5%), respectively. In addition, the number of COVID-19 patients who presented to dermatology in the last three months was 17 (11 men, 6 women). The median age of these patients was 58 (minimum 18, maximum 80) years, and the most common dermatologic diseases before diagnosed COVID-19 were superficial fungal infections (5, 25%), psoriasis (4, 20%), and viral skin diseases (3, 15%). The possible similarity between cutaneous and mucosal immunity and immunosuppression suggests that patients with some dermatologic diseases especially superficial fungal infections and psoriasis may be more vulnerable to the COVID-19.

The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the pandemic, and its corresponding State of Emergency, on a tertiary traumatology emergency service. Methods: : An observational study was performed at a tertiary hospital within the Spanish National Health System. Four different periods were studied, including the first 20 days of Spain's current State of Emergency, from March 14 to April 02, 2020 (Period 4). This period was compared to the 20-day period prior to the State of Emergency (Period 3), and to matching periods in the two previous years (Periods 1 and 2).
