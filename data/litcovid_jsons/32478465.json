Considering the significantly increased use of TCZ for the treatment of COVID-19, we would like to warn of its rare but possible serious hepatotoxicity, especially when used together with other hepatotoxic drugs. METHODS: We describe a patient with COVID-19-induced cytokine storm who developed drug-induced liver injury associated with the use of TCZ. RESULTS: One day after TCZ administration, serum transaminase levels increased 40-fold.
