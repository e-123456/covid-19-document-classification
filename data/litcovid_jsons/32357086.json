To provide reference for the training of emergency surgical nurses during the outbreak of COVID-19. Design: Guided by Kirkpatrick's model, 35 nurses in the emergency surgery department were trained according to a program that resulted from the clinical demand during the pandemic. The trainees were observed in terms of their performance at reaction level and learning level. Results: At reaction level, the degree of satisfaction scored by nurses was relatively high, with its total score achieving (18.77 +/- 3.09). At learning level, the differences between theoretical and operational scores of tested nurses before and after training proved to be statistically significant (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The application of Kirkpatrick's model based on clinical demand during the COVID-19 confirms to be effective for the training program of nurses in the emergency surgery department.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Clinical nurses were conveniently recruited by an online link in three provinces out of Hubei, including Hunan (Central south), Chongqing (Southwest) and Xinjiang (Northwest) during 4-10 February 2020. A structured questionnaire was distributed by an online investigation system. Information on sociodemographic characteristics, willingness, possible influencing factors (previous experience, health status, training conditions, perceptions on volunteering to practice in Hubei, family attitude and insurance) were collected. Binary logistic regression was conducted to explore the association of different factors with the willingness decision of nurses. RESULTS: A total of 11,183 nurses participated in this survey and a high proportion of them were willing to volunteer to practice in Hubei combating the epidemic. Nurses who were likely to volunteer had the following characteristics: younger, unmarried, members of the Communist Party of China, with senior professional qualification, working in critical care departments, with support from their families, with adequate training and learning, with good health status and low levels of anxiety. The regression model could explain 31.1% of the variances of the willingness decision of nurses. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of nurses in China were willing to practice in Hubei during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. Adequate training and psychological support would facilitate nurses to volunteer during the outbreak of an infectious disease.

We asked all plastic and esthetic surgery residents in our country to fill out a questionnaire to investigate changes in their didactical activity and analyze problems about their professional growth in the last few months. From the results of such questionnaires, we found that most of the residents feel the decrease in surgical activities during this time is a detrimental factor for their training and that even if all the schools have changed their didactical activities no school has introduced the use of virtual simulators to compensate for the decrease in surgical practice.

Virtual interactive tools are well known in different clinical and surgical specialties, and they are considered as a valid support, but it seems that in plastic surgery they are not so used.
