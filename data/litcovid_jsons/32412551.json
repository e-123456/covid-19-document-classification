X-ray imaging, although limited to specific visualizations, may be helpful for the diagnosis. In this study, the problem of automatic classification of pulmonary diseases, including the recently emerged COVID-19, from X-ray images, is considered. Methods: Deep Learning has proven to be a remarkable method to extract massive high-dimensional features from medical images. Specifically, in this paper, the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network called Mobile Net is employed and trained from scratch to investigate the importance of the extracted features for the classification task. A large-scale dataset of 3905 X-ray images, corresponding to 6 diseases, is utilized for training MobileNet v2, which has been proven to achieve excellent results in related tasks. Results: Training the CNNs from scratch outperforms the other transfer learning techniques, both in distinguishing the X-rays between the seven classes and between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19. A classification accuracy between the seven classes of 87.66% is achieved. Besides, this method achieves 99.18% accuracy, 97.36% Sensitivity, and 99.42% Specificity in the detection of COVID-19. Conclusion: The results suggest that training CNNs from scratch may reveal vital biomarkers related but not limited to the COVID-19 disease, while the top classification accuracy suggests further examination of the X-ray imaging potential.","J Med Biol Eng","Apostolopoulos, Ioannis D","Aznaouridis, Sokratis I","Tzani, Mpesiana A","32412551"],"abstract":["Purpose: While the spread of COVID-19 is increased, new, automatic, and reliable methods for accurate detection are essential to reduce the exposure of the medical experts to the outbreak.
