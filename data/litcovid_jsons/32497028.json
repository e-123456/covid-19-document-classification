Among 226 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 23% had positive test results for influenza. Among patients who had negative test results for influenza, 79 specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and 11% had evidence of infection. This sentinel surveillance system helped confirm community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. As a result of these data and an increasing number of cases with no known source of transmission, the county initiated a series of community mitigation strategies. Detection of community transmission is critical for informing response activities, including testing criteria, quarantine guidance, investigation protocols, and community mitigation measures (2). Sentinel surveillance in outpatient settings and emergency departments, implemented together with hospital-based surveillance, mortality surveillance, and serologic surveys, can provide a robust approach to monitor the epidemiology of COVID-19."],"journal":"MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep","authors":["Zwald, Marissa L","Lin, Wen","Sondermeyer Cooksey, Gail L","Weiss, Charles","Suarez, Angela","Fischer, Marc","Bonin, Brandon J","Jain, Seema","Langley, Gayle E","Park, Benjamin J","Moulia, Danielle","Benedict, Rory","Nguyen, Nang","Han, George S"],"date":"2020-04-10T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32271724","source":"PubMed","week":"202015|Apr 06 - Apr 12","doi":"10.15585/mmwr.mm6914e3","locations":["USA","USA","USA","California"],"countries":["United States"],"countries_codes":["USA|United States"],"topics":["Transmission","Prevention"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138491761721346,"score":274.41302}]}
