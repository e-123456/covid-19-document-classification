The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike. RESULTS: Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain beta (SBDbeta). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBDbeta of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor. CONCLUSIONS: We reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78.
