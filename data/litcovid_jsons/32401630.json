Additionally, the post-operative period may be a time of increased risk for severe manifestations of COVID-19. We sought to evaluate the frequency of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients who had recently had operations who were undergoing imaging for acute symptoms and the role of chest computed tomography (CT) in this setting. Patients and Methods: We included all patients who had chest CT for acute symptoms in the 15 days after a surgical procedure between March 1 and 31, 2020. Results: Of 46 patients with acute post-operative symptoms requiring chest imaging, eight (17%) were ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19.
