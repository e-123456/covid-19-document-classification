CASE SUMMARY: A 52-year-old woman presented with a high fever (38.8 degrees C), chills, dizziness, and weakness. Epidemiologically, she had not been to Wuhan where COVID-19 emerged and did not have a family history of a disease cluster. A blood test yielded a white blood cell count of 4.41 x 10(9)/L (60.6 +/- 2.67% neutrophils and 30.4 +/- 1.34% lymphocytes). Chest imaging revealed bilateral ground-glass lung changes. Based on a positive nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test result and clinical characteristics, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19.
