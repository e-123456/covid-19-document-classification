However, their prevalence in different patient populations still needs to be clarified. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed from March 27 to April 1 2020 in Northern Italy. Physicians administered a survey-based questionnaire to SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with the aim of assessing symptoms, focusing on OD and GD. Two groups were studied: patients hospitalized at ASST Spedali Civili University Hospital of Brescia (A); home-quarantined subjects (B). RESULTS: A total of 508 patients were enrolled: 295 in Group A and 213 in Group B. Mean age (+/-SD) was 55+/-15 years; 56% were men. Overall, OD and GD were present in 56% (95% CI 51-60%) and 63% (59-67%) of cases, respectively. In Group A, the prevalence of OD and GD was 44% (38-50%) and 52% (46-58%). In Group B, the prevalence of OD and GD was 72% (65-79%) and 79% (73-84%). In the entire cohort, total loss of olfaction and taste was reported in 64% and 60% of cases, respectively. OD and GD occurred as the first symptom in 10% and 11% of cases; in the remaining cases, they occurred after a mean of 4+/-3 days following the first symptom. At the time of the questionnaire, complete resolution of OD and GD was reported in 52% and 55% of cases (mean duration: 9+/-5 in both). CONCLUSIONS: OD and GD are more prevalent in home-quarantined subjects, and they are independently associated with younger age and female gender. This article is protected by copyright.
