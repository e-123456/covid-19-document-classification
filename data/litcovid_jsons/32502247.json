T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the counts of T cells and serum cytokine concentration from data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and 40 healthy controls. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers were measured in 14 COVID-19 cases. Results: The number of total T cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8(+) T cells or CD4(+) T cells lower than 800, 300, or 400/muL, respectively, were negatively correlated with patient survival. T cell numbers were negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha concentration, with patients in the disease resolution period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha concentrations and restored T cell counts. T cells from COVID-19 patients had significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1. Increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells was seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages. Conclusions: T cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted. Non-ICU patients with total T cells counts lower than 800/muL may still require urgent intervention, even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition.","Front Immunol","Diao, Bo","Wang, Chenhui","Tan, Yingjun","Chen, Xiewan","Liu, Ying","Ning, Lifen","Chen, Li","Li, Min","Liu, Yueping","Wang, Gang","Yuan, Zilin","Feng, Zeqing","Zhang, Yi","Wu, Yuzhang","Chen, Yongwen","32425950"],"abstract":["Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed great threat to human health.
