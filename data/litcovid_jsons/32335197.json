The possibility that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might cause olfactory dysfunction is certainly plausible. Patients presenting to specialized smell clinics are commonly diagnosed with upper respiratory infection (URI)-associated olfactory loss and most are presumed to be viral related. In acute phases of infection, it is common to experience some smell loss as a result of nasal inflammation, mucosal edema, and obstruction of airflow into the olfactory cleft. In most cases, these episodes of smell loss are self-limiting and coincide with resolution of URI symptoms. However, in some cases the smell loss persists for months to years and this is presumed to occur through a more direct olfactory insult by the virus. It remains too early to know whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes persistent olfactory dysfunction. However, given the scale of this pandemic, if SARS-CoV-2 does cause chronic olfactory loss in even a small portion of those infected, then the overall population prevalence could be quite large. This review provides a brief, practical overview of viral-associated olfactory loss, realizing that evidence related to COVID-19 will likely not be clear for some time. Our goal is to highlight the existence and importance of this condition and provide information geared for both providers and patients.

We sought to use Google Trends (GT) to investigate whether there was a surge in individuals searching for information related to smell loss during the COVID-19 epidemic in the Italy, Spain, UK, USA, Germany, France, Iran and Netherlands. METHODS: GT was used to explore Internet activity related to loss of smell in Italy, Spain, UK, USA, Germany, France, Iran and Netherlands. Spearman rank analysis was performed to correlate loss of smell relative search volumes (RSV) with the increases of daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 and deaths attributed to disease. As a control event, we also performed analysis of smell-related searches during the last UK Influenza epidemic of 2009. RESULTS: In all three countries, we observed strong correlations between daily RSVs related to loss of smell, increases of daily COVID-19+ cases and deaths ranging from 0.633 to 0.952.

CONCLUSION: There is a strong correlation between the frequency of searches for smell-related information and the onset of COVID-19 infection in Italy, Spain, UK, USA, Germany, France, Iran and Netherlands.
