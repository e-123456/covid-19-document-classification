In order to follow biosafety recommendations, we used Ultrasound-Guided Minimally Invasive Autopsy (MIA-US) to assess the systemic involvement of COVID-19 and present the results of ten initial autopsies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used MIA-US for tissue sampling of lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, spleen, brain, skin, skeletal muscle and testis for histology and RT-PCR to detect SARS-COV-2-RNA. All patients presented exudative/proliferative Diffuse Alveolar Damage. There were intense pleomorphic cytopathic effects on the respiratory epithelium, including airway and alveolar cells. Fibrinous thrombi in alveolar arterioles were present in eight patients and all patients presented a high density of alveolar megakaryocytes. Small thrombi were less frequently observed in glomeruli, spleen, heart, dermis, testis, and liver sinusoids. The main systemic findings were associated with comorbidities, age, and sepsis, in addition to possible tissue damage due to the viral infection such as myositis, dermatitis, myocarditis and orchitis. CONCLUSIONS: MIA-US is safe and effective for the study of severe COVID-19. Our findings show that COVID-19 is a systemic disease with major events in the lungs and involvement of various organs and tissues. Pulmonary changes are the result of severe epithelial injury and microthrombotic vascular phenomena.

Methods: For 10 decedents with 2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan, bilateral lungs underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous multi-point puncture autopsy, and pulmonary pathological changes were described in routine hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) slides. Electron microscopy was also performed. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to detect 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in lung tissue, and the pathological characteristics were demonstrated in combination with clinical data analysis. Results: Of the 10 deaths associated with COVID-19, 7 were male and 3 were female. The average age was 70 (39-87) years. Medical record showed that 7 patients had underlying diseases.
