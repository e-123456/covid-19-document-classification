As barriers to adoption of telemedicine are rapidly decreasing, it is important to recognize the need for practical and immediately deployable information that can improve doctor-patient interactions, facilitate accurate documentation, and increase confidence in the transition to virtual visits. In this article we aim to outline the components of an outpatient telemedicine visit for physiatrists, with a particular focus on an adapted virtual physical examination. Uses of telemedicine may include future large scale concerns such as natural disasters or climate change. We describe a general approach to the visit, review definitions of terms commonly used in telemedicine, and offer tips for optimizing the encounter.","PM R","Verduzco-Gutierrez, Monica","Bean, Allison C","Tenforde, Adam S","Tapia, Rebecca N","Silver, Julie K","32297458"],"abstract":["The novel coronavirus pandemic is resulting in an accelerated conversion of in-person physician visits to virtual visits.

Predictably, as the virus becomes less prevalent, there will be a tremendous motivation to move forward with scheduling operations from both patient care and institutional perspectives. However, one can anticipate a pandemic-related increase in surgical morbidity and mortality above pre-pandemic levels, particularly in older or medically frail patients even if they did not have COVID-19.
