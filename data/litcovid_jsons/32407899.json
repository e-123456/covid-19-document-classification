MATERIALS AND METHOD: The FRANCOGYN group of the National College of French Gynecologists and Obstetricians (CNGOF) convened to develop recommendations based on the consensus conference model. RESULTS: If a patient with a gynecologic cancer presents with COVID-19, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, radiotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy could replace surgery as first-line treatment and the value of lymph node staging should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be preferred over primary cytoreduction surgery. It is legitimate not to perform hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. For patients who are scheduled to undergo interval surgery, chemotherapy can be continued and surgery performed after 6 cycles. For patients with early stage endometrial cancer of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy combined with a sentinel lymph node procedure is recommended. Surgery can be postponed for 1-2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For patients of high ESMO risk, the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) should be applied to avoid pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomy. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, management of a patient with cancer should be adapted to limit the risks associated with the virus without incurring loss of chance.","J Gynecol Obstet Hum Reprod","Akladios, Cherif","Azais, Henri","Ballester, Marcos","Bendifallah, Sofiane","Bolze, Pierre-Adrien","Bourdel, Nicolas","Bricou, Alexandre","Canlorbe, Geoffroy","Carcopino, Xavier","Chauvet, Pauline","Collinet, Pierre","Coutant, Charles","Dabi, Yohann","Dion, Ludivine","Gauthier, Tristan","Graesslin, Olivier","Huchon, Cyrille","Koskas, Martin","Kridelka, Frederic","Lavoue, Vincent","Lecointre, Lise","Mezzadri, Matthieu","Mimoun, Camille","Ouldamer, Lobna","Raimond, Emilie","Touboul, Cyril","32247066"],"abstract":["INTRODUCTION: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, specific recommendations are required for the management of patients with gynecologic cancer.
