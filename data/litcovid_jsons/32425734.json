Secondary outcomes were direct costs, reimbursement, personal protective equipment used and personnel infected. Disease prevalence, testing accuracy, and costs were obtained from literature. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, endoscopy volume was 12.7% of expected. Strategy 2 and 3 were safe and effective interventions to resume endoscopy in semi-urgent and elective cases.
