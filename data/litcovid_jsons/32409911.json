With the growing COVID-19 pandemic stretching limited healthcare resources, postponing surgery becomes an inevitable and unenviable task for most orthopaedic surgeons, and a shift in outpatient paradigms is required to mitigate poor outcomes in patients. METHODS: A scoping review of five databases on surgical timing and orthopaedic soft-tissue injuries was performed. All randomized controlled trials, longitudinal cohort studies, retrospective case series, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and expert opinions were included for review, with 65 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Better outcomes appear to be associated with early surgery for subluxations (< 1 week), recurrent dislocations (> 2 episodes), ligamentous and tendinous injuries (< 2 weeks), and bony avulsion injuries (< 3 weeks). Spinal conditions with neurological compromise should be operated on within 24 hours and spinal instability within 72 hours to reduce the risk of complications and poor outcomes. CONCLUSION: Most soft-tissue orthopaedic injuries can be managed with outpatient ambulatory surgery in a semi-elective setting. As the paradigm for outpatient surgery shifts due to technological advances and the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical for surgeons to time their surgery appropriately to maintain the high standards of orthopaedic practice.","Int Orthop","Ding, Benjamin Tze Keong","Decruz, Joshua","Kunnasegaran, Remesh","32409911"],"abstract":["PURPOSE: Timing of surgery for orthopaedic injuries continues to evolve, as an improved understanding of biology, healing, and technological advances continues to challenge historical norms.

The orthopaedic and trauma units have rescheduled their activities to help SARS-CoV-2 units, but trauma patients require also treatment, and no standardized protocols have been established. METHODS: A single-centre cross-sectional study was performed in a tertiary hospital. Two different periods of time were analyzed: a two week period of time in March 2019 (pre-SARS-CoV-2) and the same period in March 2020 (SARS-CoV-2 pandemic time). Outpatient's data, emergency activity, surgical procedures, and admissions were evaluated. Surgeons' and patient's opinion was also evaluated using a survey. RESULTS: A total of ~ 16k (15,953) patients were evaluated. Scheduled clinical appointments decreased by ~ 22%. Urgent consultations and discharge from clinics also descended (~ 37% and ~ 20% respectively). Telemedicine was used in 90% of outpatient clinical evaluations. No elective surgical procedures during SARS-CoV-2 time were scheduled, and subtracting the effect of elective surgeries, there was a reduction of inpatient surgeries, from ~ 85% to ~ 59%. Patients delayed trauma assistance more than 48 hours in 13 cases (35%). Pre-operative admission for hip fractures decreased in ten hours on average. Finally, surveys stated that patients were more in favour than surgeons were to this new way to evaluate orthopaedic and trauma patients based strongly on telemedicine.

The toughest issue traumatic orthopaedic surgeons are faced with is how to maintain a balance between adequate COVID-19 screening and timely surgery. In this study, we described our experience with pre-operative COVID-19 screening in patients with traumatic fractures. Furthermore, we analysed the clinical results of fracture patients undergoing confined or emergency surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This was a case series study. Patients with traumatic fractures who were admitted to our hospital for surgery were enrolled in this study during the COVID-19 outbreak from March to April 2020. All patients were enrolled and managed using the standardized clinical pathway we designed for preoperative COVID-19 screening. Clinical, laboratory and outcome data were analysed. RESULTS: The average surgery waiting time from injury to surgery was 8.7 +/- 3.4 days. The average waiting time from admission to surgery was 5.3 +/- 2.8 days. These average waiting times were increased by 4.1 days and 2.0 days, respectively, compared with 2019 data.
