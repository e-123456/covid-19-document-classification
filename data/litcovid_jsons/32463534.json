Multiple reports have suggested that patients with heart failure (HF) are at a higher risk of severe disease and mortality with COVID-19. Moreover, evaluating and treating HF patients with comorbid COVID-19 represents a formidable clinical challenge as symptoms of both conditions may overlap and they may potentiate each other. Limited data exist regarding comprehensive management of HF patients with concomitant COVID-19. Since these issues pose serious new challenges for clinicians worldwide, HF specialists must develop a structured approach to the care of patients with COVID-19 and be included early in the care of these patients. Therefore, the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology and Chinese Heart Failure Association & National Heart Failure Committee conducted web-based meetings to discuss these unique clinical challenges and reach a consensus opinion to help providers worldwide deliver better patient care. The main objective of this position paper is to outline the management of HF patients with concomitant COVID-19 based on the available data and personal experiences of physicians from Asia, Europe and United States.

While there are widespread reports of intentional reductions in elective hospitalizations, trends in urgent or emergent hospitalizations including heart failure (HF) hospitalizations have not been adequately characterized. Methods: We evaluated trends of HF hospitalizations before and during the COVID-19 pandemic at the University of Mississippi Medical Center using electronic health records and discharge database.

Results: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in our medical center, a mean of 30 patients per week were admitted with a principal diagnosis of HF. After the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Mississippi, there was a sharp 50% decline in the number of HF hospitalizations that declined even further after a \"state of emergency\" was declared in Mississippi.
