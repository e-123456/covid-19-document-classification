Convalescent plasma containing high level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody has been used in clinical therapy and achieved good effects in China.

Our data showed that the concentration of IgG antibody in mild, general and recovering patients showed no difference between male and female patients. In severe status, compared with male patients, there were more female patients having a relatively high concentration of serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. In addition, the generation of IgG antibody in female patients was stronger than male patients in disease early phase.
