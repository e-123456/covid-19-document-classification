METHODS: Systematic literature search from several electronic databases were performed. The outcome was mortality (non-survivor) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. NT-proBNP data were in continuous variable (pg/mL), dichotomous data (elevated/non-elevated) and effect estimate adjusted to cardiac injury/elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury. RESULTS: A total of 967 patients from six studies were included in this analysis. NT-proBNP was higher in non-survivor group (standardised mean difference 0.75 (0.44, 1.07), p<0.001; I(2): 61%).

Conclusions and Relevance: Myocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury is relatively favorable. Myocardial injury is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. Inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury. Aggressive treatment may be considered for patients at high risk of myocardial injury."],"journal":"JAMA Cardiol","authors":["Guo, Tao","Fan, Yongzhen","Chen, Ming","Wu, Xiaoyan","Zhang, Lin","He, Tao","Wang, Hairong","Wan, Jing","Wang, Xinghuan","Lu, Zhibing"],"date":"2020-03-29T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32219356","source":"PubMed","week":"202013|Mar 23 - Mar 29","doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017","locations":["Wuhan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Mechanism","Treatment"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138490482458625,"score":339.66608}]}
