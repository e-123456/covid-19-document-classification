ACE2 is widely distributed in the heart, kidneys, lungs, and testes. ACE2 antagonizes the activation of the classical RAS system and protects against organ damage, protecting against hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

ARDS is a clinical high-mortality disease, and ACE2 has a protective effect on this type of acute lung injury.
