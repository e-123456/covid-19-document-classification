Methods: For 10 decedents with 2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan, bilateral lungs underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous multi-point puncture autopsy, and pulmonary pathological changes were described in routine hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) slides. Electron microscopy was also performed. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to detect 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in lung tissue, and the pathological characteristics were demonstrated in combination with clinical data analysis. Results: Of the 10 deaths associated with COVID-19, 7 were male and 3 were female. The average age was 70 (39-87) years. Medical record showed that 7 patients had underlying diseases. The average course of disease was 30 (16-36) days. Nine cases showed fibrinous and suppurative exudation in the alveolar cavity accompanied by the formation of hyaline membrane, and fibroblastic proliferation of alveolar septum. Type alveolar epithelial cells showed reactive hyperplasia and desquamation. Many macrophages accumulated in the alveolar cavity. Capillary hyaline thrombus and intravascular mixed thrombus were noted. In some cases, acute bronchiolitis with mucous membrane exfoliation, accumulation of bronchiolar secretions, and bronchiolar epithelial metaplasia occurred. In the cohort, a large number of bacteria (cocci) were detected in 1 case and a large number of fungi (yeast type) were detected in 1 case. Nine cases were positive for the nucleic acids of 2019-nCoV while one case remained negative by RT-PCR. Coronavirus particles were detected in the cytoplasm of type alveolar epithelium. Conclusions: The pulmonary pathological changes of fatal COVID-19 are diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), mainly in the acute exudative stage and the organic proliferative stage. There are fibrinous exudate aggregation in alveolar cavity with hyaline membrane formation, fibroblastic proliferation in alveolar septum, and alveolar epithelial cell injuries with reactive hyperplasia and desquamation of type alveolar epithelial cells. A large amount of neutrophils and monocytes infiltration is present in most cases and bacteria and fungi are detected in some cases, suggesting a serious bacterial or fungal infection secondary to the DAD.","Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi","Wu, J H","Li, X","Huang, B","Su, H","Li, Y","Luo, D J","Chen, S","Ma, L","Wang, S H","Nie, X","Peng, L","32486534"],"abstract":["Objectives: To observe the pulmonary changes with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in postmortem needle specimens, to detect the presence of 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) in the lung tissues, and to analyze the clinicopathological characteristics.

Five patients' peripheral blood lymphocyte count decreased in the early stage of the disease, and 10 patients' peripheral blood lymphocyte count decreased significantly before the disease progressed or died. Seven cases were treated with corticosteroid (methylprednisolone </=40 mg/d, not more than 5 days).

Furthermore, autopsies are essential for the correct statistical recording of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths. In the northern German Federal State of Hamburg, all deaths of Hamburg citizens with ante- or postmortem PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection have been autopsied since the outbreak of the pandemic in Germany. Our evaluation provides a systematic overview of the first 80 consecutive full autopsies. A proposal for the categorisation of deaths with SARS-CoV-2 infection is presented (category 1: definite COVID-19 death; category 2: probable COVID-19 death; category 3: possible COVID-19 death with an equal alternative cause of death; category 4: SARS-CoV-2 detection with cause of death not associated to COVID-19). In six cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed postmortem by a positive PCR test in a nasopharyngeal or lung tissue swab. In the other 74 cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection had already been known antemortem. The deceased were aged between 52 and 96 years (average 79.2 years, median 82.4 years). In the study cohort, 34 deceased were female (38%) and 46 male (62%). Overall, 38% of the deceased were overweight or obese. All deceased, except for two women, in whom no significant pre-existing conditions were found autoptically, had relevant comorbidities (in descending order of frequency): (1) diseases of the cardiovascular system, (2) lung diseases, (3) central nervous system diseases, (4) kidney diseases, and (5) diabetes mellitus. A total of 76 cases (95%) were classified as COVID-19 deaths, corresponding to categories 1-3. Four deaths (5%) were defined as non-COVID-19 deaths with virus-independent causes of death.

Furthermore, autopsies are essential for the correct statistical recording of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths. In the northern German Federal State of Hamburg, all deaths of Hamburg citizens with ante- or postmortem PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection have been autopsied since the outbreak of the pandemic in Germany. Our evaluation provides a systematic overview of the first 80 consecutive full autopsies. A proposal for the categorisation of deaths with SARS-CoV-2 infection is presented (category 1: definite COVID-19 death; category 2: probable COVID-19 death; category 3: possible COVID-19 death with an equal alternative cause of death; category 4: SARS-CoV-2 detection with cause of death not associated to COVID-19). In six cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed postmortem by a positive PCR test in a nasopharyngeal or lung tissue swab. In the other 74 cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection had already been known antemortem. The deceased were aged between 52 and 96 years (average 79.2 years, median 82.4 years). In the study cohort, 34 deceased were female (38%) and 46 male (62%). Overall, 38% of the deceased were overweight or obese. All deceased, except for two women, in whom no significant pre-existing conditions were found autoptically, had relevant comorbidities (in descending order of frequency): (1) diseases of the cardiovascular system, (2) lung diseases, (3) central nervous system diseases, (4) kidney diseases, and (5) diabetes mellitus. A total of 76 cases (95%) were classified as COVID-19 deaths, corresponding to categories 1-3. Four deaths (5%) were defined as non-COVID-19 deaths with virus-independent causes of death.
