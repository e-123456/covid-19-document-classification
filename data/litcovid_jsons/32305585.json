OBJECTIVES: Systematic assessment of VTE using complete duplex ultrasound (CDU) in anticoagulated COVID-19 patients.

A CDU from thigh to ankle at selected sites with Doppler waveforms and images was performed early during ICU stay in patients admitted with COVID-19.

RESULTS: From March 19(th) to April 11(th) of 2020, 26 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 were screened for VTE. 8 patients (31%) were treated with prophylactic anticoagulation whereas 18 patients (69%) were treated with therapeutic anticoagulation.
