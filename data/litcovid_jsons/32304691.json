New York currently represents an epicenter for COVID-19 infection in the United States, with 84,735 cases reported as of April 2, 2020. We previously presented an early experience with seven COVID-positive patients in pregnancy, including two women who were diagnosed with COVID-19 following an asymptomatic initial presentation. We now describe a series of 43 test-confirmed cases of COVID-19 presenting to a pair of affiliated New York City hospitals over two weeks from March 13 to 27, 2020. Fourteen (32.6%) patients presented without any COVID-associated viral symptoms, and were identified either after developing symptoms during admission or following the implementation of universal testing for all obstetrical admissions on March 22. Of these, 10/14 (71.4%) developed symptoms or signs of COVID-19 infection over the course of their delivery admission or early after postpartum discharge. Of the other 29 (67.4%) patients who presented with symptomatic COVID-19 infection, three women ultimately required antenatal admission for viral symptoms, and an additional patient represented six days postpartum after a successful labor induction with worsening respiratory status that required oxygen supplementation. There were no confirmed cases of COVID-19 detected in neonates upon initial testing on the first day of life. Applying COVID-19 disease severity characteristics as described by Wu et al, 37 (86%) women possessed mild disease, four (9.3%) exhibited severe disease, and two (4.7%) developed critical disease; these percentages are similar to those described for non-pregnant adults with COVID-19 infections (about 80% mild, 15% severe, and 5% critical disease).","Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM","Breslin, Noelle","Baptiste, Caitlin","Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia","Miller, Russell","Martinez, Rebecca","Bernstein, Kyra","Ring, Laurence","Landau, Ruth","Purisch, Stephanie","Friedman, Alexander M","Fuchs, Karin","Sutton, Desmond","Andrikopoulou, Maria","Rupley, Devon","Sheen, Jean-Ju","Aubey, Janice","Zork, Noelia","Moroz, Leslie","Mourad, Mirella","Wapner, Ronald","Simpson, Lynn L","D'Alton, Mary E","Goffman, Dena","32292903"],"abstract":["The novel coronavirus 2019, or COVID-19, infection has rapidly spread through the New York metropolitan area since the first reported case in the state on March 1, 2020.
