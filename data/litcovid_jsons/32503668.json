METHODS: A cohort of patients with covid-19 admitted to the Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University from January 11, 2020 to March 3, 2020 was retrospectively analyzed. Patients with hematologic malignancy were excluded. The NLR was calculated by dividing the neutrophil count by the lymphocyte count. NLR values were measured at the time of admission. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. A multivariate logistic analysis was performed. RESULTS: 1004 patients with covid-19 were included in this study. The mortality rate was 4.0% (40 cases). The median age of nonsurvivors (68 years) was significantly older than survivors (62 years). Male sex was more predominant in nonsurvival group (27; 67.5%) than in the survival group (466; 48.3%). NLR value of nonsurvival group (median 49.06, IQR 25.71-69.70) was higher than that of survival group (median 4.11, IQR 2.44-8.12, P < 0.001).
