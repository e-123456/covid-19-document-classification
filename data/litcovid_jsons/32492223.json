We evaluated the impact of two aerosol boxes (an early-generation box and a latest-generation box) on intubations in patients with severe COVID-19 with an in-situ simulation crossover study. The simulated process complied with the Safe Airway Society COVID-19 airway management guidelines. The primary outcome was intubation time; secondary outcomes included first-pass success and breaches to personal protective equipment. All intubations were performed by specialist (consultant) anaesthetists and video recorded. Twelve anaesthetists performed 36 intubations. Intubation time with no aerosol box was significantly shorter than with the early-generation box ((median (IQR [range])) 42.9 (32.9-46.9 [30.9-57.6]) seconds vs. 82.1(45.1-98.3 [30.8-180.0]) seconds, p=0.002) and the latest-generation box (52.4(43.1-70.3 [35.7-169.2]) seconds, p=0.008). No intubations without a box took more than one minute, whereas 14 (58%) intubations with a box took over one minute and 4 (17%) took over two minutes (including one failure). Without an aerosol box, all anaesthetists obtained first-pass success. With the early-generation and latest-generation boxes, 9 (75%) and 10 (83%) participants obtained first-pass success respectively.
