OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence-based estimates of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 and projected cumulative numbers of severely ill pediatric COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization during the US 2020 pandemic. DESIGN: Empirical case projection study MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:: Adjusted pediatric severity proportions and adjusted pediatric criticality proportions were derived from clinical and spatiotemporal modelling studies of the COVID-19 epidemic in China for the period Jan-Feb 2020. Estimates of total children infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the US through April 6, 2020 were calculated using US pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) cases and the adjusted pediatric criticality proportion. Projected numbers of severely and critically ill children with COVID-19 were derived by applying the adjusted severity and criticality proportions to US population data, under several scenarios of cumulative pediatric infection proportion (CPIP). RESULTS: By April 6, 2020, there were 74 children who had been reported admitted to PICUs in 19 states, reflecting an estimated 176 190 children nationwide infected with SARS-CoV-2 (52 381 infants and toddlers <2 years, 42 857 children 2-11 years, and 80 952 children 12-17 years). Under a CPIP scenario of 5%, there would be 3.7 million children infected with SARS-CoV-2, 9907 severely ill children requiring hospitalization, and 1086 critically ill children requiring PICU admission. Under a CPIP scenario of 50%, 10 865 children would require PICU admission, 99 073 would require hospitalization for severe pneumonia, and 37.0 million would be infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Because there are 74.0 million children 0-17 years old in the US, the projected numbers of severe cases could overwhelm available pediatric hospital care resources under several moderate CPIP scenarios, despite lower severity of COVID-19 in children than in adults.","J Public Health Manag Pract","Pathak, Elizabeth Barnett","Salemi, Jason L","Sobers, Natasha","Menard, Janelle","Hambleton, Ian R","32282440"],"abstract":["IMPORTANCE: A surge in severe cases of COVID-19 in children would present unique challenges for hospitals and public health preparedness efforts in the United States.
