The COVID-19 pandemic has illuminated systemic health disparities and weaknesses within our health care and political systems. With aggressive but necessary interventions to thwart the instantaneous reproduction number, we have simultaneously introduced risk factors for new and exacerbated mental health concerns. Suicide, an ongoing pandemic whose rates are higher than they have been in the past 50 years, is one of these concerns as we navigate COVID-19 deaths and fears surrounding its spread. This article aims to briefly describe in retrospect some of the historical pandemics and their downstream consequences as well as present what may lie ahead in terms of anxiety, depression, and suicidal behaviors. This applies not only to frontline health care workers but also the public at large, who may very well experience long-term stressor- and trauma-related consequences through ongoing exposure to a virus that is not only potentially fatal but may have taken the lives of loved ones.

The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dimensions of the suicidal process and its interaction with the various risk factors. We also propose innovative strategies to manage suicidal behavior in the context of pandemic. METHODS: We carried out a narrative review of international publications dealing with major pandemics (COVID-19, SARS) and their influence on suicidal vulnerability. RESULTS: Many factors are likely to increase the emergence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts during this crisis. Social distancing and quarantine could increase the feeling of disconnection and the perception of social pain in vulnerable individuals. Some populations at high suicidal risk could be further impacted by the current pandemic: the elderly, medical staff and individuals exposed to economic insecurity. Several innovative tools adapted to the constraints of social distancing and quarantine may prevent suicide risk: e-health, VigilanS, buddhist-derived practices and art engagement. CONCLUSIONS: This unprecedented crisis may interact with certain dimensions of the suicidal process. However, it is time to innovate. Several suicide prevention tools all have their place in new modes of care and should be tested on a large scale.","Encephale","Conejero, I","Berrouiguet, S","Ducasse, D","Leboyer, M","Jardon, V","Olie, E","Courtet, P","32471707"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic affected today more than 3,000,000 worldwide, and more than half of humanity has been placed in quarantine.
