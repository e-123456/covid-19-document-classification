Material & methods: Gamunex((R))-C and Flebogamma((R)) DIF (Grifols) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) products were tested using ELISA techniques for antibodies against several antigens of human common betacoronaviruses that may crossreact with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Results: Both IVIGs showed consistent reactivity to components of the tested viruses. Positive crossreactivity was seen in SARS-CoV, middle east respiratory syndrome-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
