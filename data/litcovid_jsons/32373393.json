The thiol modified ASO capped AuNPs agglomerate selectively in the presence of its target RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate a change in its surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Further, the addition of RNaseH cleaves the RNA strand from the RNA-DNA hybrid leading to a visually detectable precipitate from the solution mediated by the additional agglomeration among the AuNPs. The selectivity of the assay has been monitored in presence of MERS-CoV viral RNA with a limit of detection of 0.18 ng/microL of RNA having SARS-CoV-2 viral load.
