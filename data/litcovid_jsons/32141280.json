The most prevalent comorbidity were hypertension (17 +/- 7, 95% CI 14-22%) and diabetes ( 8 +/- 6, 95% CI 6-11% ), followed by cardiovascular diseases ( 5 +/- 4, 95% CI 4-7% ) and respiratory system disease( 2 +/- 0, 95% CI 1-3% ). Compared with the Non-severe patient, the pooled odds ratio of hypertension, respiratory system disease, cardiovascular disease in severe patients were (OR 2.36, 95% CI: 1.46-3.83), (OR 2.46, 95% CI: 1.76-3.44) and (OR 3.42, 95% CI: 1.88-6.22)respectively. CONCLUSION: We assessed the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 infection patients and found underlying disease, including hypertension, respiratory system disease and cardiovascular, may be a risk factor for severe patients compared with Non-severe patients."],"journal":"Int J Infect Dis","authors":["Yang, Jing","Zheng, Ya","Gou, Xi","Pu, Ke","Chen, Zhaofeng","Guo, Qinghong","Ji, Rui","Wang, Haojia","Wang, Yuping","Zhou, Yongning"],"date":"2020-03-17T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32173574","week":"202012|Mar 16 - Mar 22","doi":"10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.017","keywords":["2019-nCoV","COVID-19","Clinical characteristics","Comorbidities","Epidemiologicalm","Meta-analysis"],"source":"PubMed","locations":["Wuhan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"weight":0,"_version_":1661456248860573697,"score":97.05902}]}
