Emergency department (ED) staff are particularly vulnerable when managing patients with acute respiratory distress due to the aerosolization of the virus during endotracheal intubation. A simple and innovative intubation tent was designed with the intent of decreasing the risk of accidental viral transmission from emergent intubations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Presentation of technique: The materials and assembly process of the novel \"Corona Curtain\" are described in technical detail, with the intent of allowing other providers to template the concept at their respective facilities. Results: A total of 36 intubation tents were mounted in the ED at the Medical Center of Aurora, Colorado, on April 7, 2020, and thereafter consistently used for all intubations during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. The cost of raw materials and labor for the initial assembly averaged US $ 8.00 per construct. The price of the single-use plastic cover is variable depending on the vendor source. Conclusion: The new \"Corona Curtain\" was designed to improve the safety of ED staff when performing urgent/emergent intubations during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The concept can easily be adopted to other patient care areas, including perioperative and intensive care units.
