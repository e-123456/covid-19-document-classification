Infodemiology metrics have been widely and successfully employed in order to assess and forecast epidemics and outbreaks. OBJECTIVE: In light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic that started in Wuhan, China, in 2019, in this report online search traffic data from Google are used aiming at tracking the spread of the new Coronavirus. METHODS: Time-series from Google Trends from January to March 2020 on the topic of \"Coronavirus\" are retrieved and correlated with official data on COVID-19 cases and deaths in the European countries that have been affected the most; Italy (at national and regional level), Spain, France, Germany, and the UK. RESULTS: Statistically significant correlations are observed between the online interest and COVID-19 cases and deaths. Furthermore, a critical point after which the Pearson correlation coefficient starts declining (even if it is still is statistically significant) is identified, indicating that this method is most efficient in regions or countries that have not peaked in COVID-19 cases yet. CONCLUSIONS: In the past, infodemiology metrics in general and data from Google Trends in specific, have been shown to be useful in tracking and forecasting outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics, as, for example, in the cases of MERS, Ebola, measles, and Zika.

The expansion of telehealth services is expected to deliver timely care for the initial screening of symptomatic patients while minimizing exposure in health care facilities, to protect health care providers and other patients. However, it is currently unknown whether US hospitals have the telehealth capacity to meet the increasing demand and needs of patients during this pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the population-level internet search volume for telehealth (as a proxy of population interest and demand) with the number of new COVID-19 cases and the proportion of hospitals that adopted a telehealth system in all US states. METHODS: We used internet search volume data from Google Trends to measure population-level interest in telehealth and telemedicine between January 21, 2020 (when the first COVID-19 case was reported), and March 18, 2020. Data on COVID-19 cases in the United States were obtained from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resources Center. We also used data from the 2018 American Hospital Association Annual Survey to estimate the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth (including telemedicine and electronic visits) and those with the capability of telemedicine intensive care unit (tele-ICU). Pearson correlation was used to examine the relations of population search volume for telehealth and telemedicine (composite score) with the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases in the United States during the study period and the proportion of hospitals with telehealth and tele-ICU capabilities. RESULTS: We found that US population-level interest in telehealth increased as the number of COVID-19 cases increased, with a strong correlation (<i>r</i>=0.948, <i>P</i><.001). We observed a higher population-level interest in telehealth in the Northeast and West census region, whereas the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth was higher in the Midwest region. There was no significant association between population interest and the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth (<i>r</i>=0.055, <i>P</i>=.70) nor hospitals having tele-ICU capability (<i>r</i>=-0.073, <i>P</i>=.61). CONCLUSIONS: As the number of COVID-19 cases increases, so does the US population's interest in telehealth. However, the level of population interest did not correlate with the proportion of hospitals providing telehealth services in the United States, suggesting that increased population demand may not be met with the current telehealth capacity. Telecommunication infrastructures in US hospitals may lack the capability to address the ongoing health care needs of patients with other health conditions.
