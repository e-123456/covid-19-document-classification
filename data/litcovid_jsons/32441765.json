OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the association between different degrees of hyperglycemia and the risk of all-cause mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: A retrospective study. SETTING: Union Hospital in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: 453 patients were admitted to the hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection from January 22, 2020 to March 17, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patients were classified into four categories: normal glucose, hyperglycemia (fasting glucose 5.6-6.9 mmol/L and/or HbA1c 5.7-6.4%), newly diagnosed diabetes (fasting glucose >/=7 mmol/L and/or HbA1c >/=6.5%), and known diabetes. The major outcomes included in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). RESULTS: Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes had the highest percentage to be admitted to the ICU (11.7%) and require IMV (11.7%), followed by patients with known diabetes (4.1%; 9.2%) and patients with hyperglycemia (6.2%; 4.7%), compared with patients with normal glucose (1.5%; 2.3%), respectively.
