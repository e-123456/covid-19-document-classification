Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data were collected. Patients were followed up to March 10, 2020, and dynamic profiles of nucleic acid testing results in throat swabs and fecal specimens were closely monitored. RESULTS: Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas viral RNA remained detectable in stools of pediatric patients for longer than 4 weeks. Two children had fecal SARS-CoV-2 undetectable 20 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 8 days. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 may exist in children's gastrointestinal tract for a longer time than respiratory system.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, risk factors associated with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA shedding were evaluated in a cohort of 113 symptomatic patients from two hospitals outside Wuhan. RESULTS: The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 17 days (Interquartile Range [IQR], 13-22 days) as measured from illness onset. When comparing patients with early (<15 days) and late viral RNA clearance (>/=15 days after illness onset), prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was associated with male sex (p=0.009), old age (p=0.033), concomitated with hypertension (p=0.009), delayed admission to hospital after illness onset (p=0.001), severe illness at admission (p=0.049), invasive mechanical ventilation (p=0.006), and corticosteroid treatment (p=0.025).
