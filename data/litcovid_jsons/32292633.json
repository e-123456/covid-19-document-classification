Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 nurses who cared for patients with COVID-19. Interview data were analyzed by category analysis from the perspective of the existence, relatedness, and growth theory (ERG). Results: The existence needs were mainly reflected in health and security needs, whereas the relatedness needs consisted mainly of interpersonal needs, humanistic concern needs, and family needs; further, the growth needs were mainly reflected as a strong need for knowledge. Existence needs were the main needs during the epidemic, with health and security needs influencing each other. Humanistic concern needs were the most important of the relatedness needs; interpersonal and family needs were also growing. Conclusion: It is found that the existence, relatedness, and growth needs coexist in clinical nurses. It is helpful to take effective interventions to meet their needs if the needs of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients could be perceived well.","Int J Nurs Sci","Yin, Xue","Zeng, Lingdan","32292633"],"abstract":["Objective: This study aimed to explore the psychological needs of nurses caring for patients with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) and to propose corresponding interventions.

However, those outcomes have yet to be established using epidemiological data. To explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff and the efficacy, or lack thereof, of critically connecting psychological needs to receiving psychological care, we conducted a quantitative study. This is the first paper on the mental health of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan. Notably, among 994 medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan, 36.9% had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0), and 6.2% had severe disturbance (mean PHQ-9: 15.1) in the immediate wake of the viral epidemic. The noted burden fell particularly heavily on young women. Of all participants, 36.3% had accessed psychological materials (such as books on mental health), 50.4% had accessed psychological resources available through media (such as online push messages on mental health self-help coping methods), and 17.5% had participated in counseling or psychotherapy. Trends in levels of psychological distress and factors such as exposure to infected people and psychological assistance were identified. Although staff accessed limited mental healthcare services, distressed staff nonetheless saw these services as important resources to alleviate acute mental health disturbances and improve their physical health perceptions. These findings emphasize the importance of being prepared to support frontline workers through mental health interventions at times of widespread crisis.","Brain Behav Immun","Kang, Lijun","Ma, Simeng","Chen, Min","Yang, Jun","Wang, Ying","Li, Ruiting","Yao, Lihua","Bai, Hanping","Cai, Zhongxiang","Xiang Yang, Bing","Hu, Shaohua","Zhang, Kerang","Wang, Gaohua","Ma, Ci","Liu, Zhongchun","32240764"],"abstract":["The severe 2019 outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, would be expected to impact the mental health of local medical and nursing staff and thus lead them to seek help.
