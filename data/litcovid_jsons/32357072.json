We aimed to further clarify the clinical characteristics of diabetes with COVID-19. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with diabetes and COVID-19 were enrolled from January 29, 2020, to February 10, 2020, with a final follow-up on February 22, 2020. Epidemiologic, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were analyzed. Results: The average age of the 28 patients was 68.6 +/- 9.0 years. Most (75%) patients were male. Only 39.3% of the patients had a clear exposure of COVID-19. Fever (92.9%), dry cough (82.1%), and fatigue (64.3%) were the most common symptoms, followed by dyspnea (57.1%), anorexia (57.1%), diarrhea (42.9%), expectoration (25.0%), and nausea (21.4%). Fourteen patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The hemoglobin A1c level was similar between ICU and non-ICU patients. ICU patients had a higher respiratory rate, higher levels of random blood glucose, aspartate transaminase, bilirubin, creatine, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, troponin I, D-dimers, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, and IL-8 than non-ICU patients. Eleven of 14 ICU patients received noninvasive ventilation and 7 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation. Twelve patients died in the ICU group and no patients died in the nonICU group. Conclusion: ICU cases showed higher rates of organ failure and mortality than non-ICU cases. The poor outcomes of patients with diabetes and COVID-19 indicated that more supervision is required in these patients.

Furthermore, patchy consolidation on CT on admission was associated with a higher risk of developing severe events (HR = 5.438, 95% CI 1.498-19.748, P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the COVID-19 infection. It is recommended that cancer patients receiving antitumour treatments should have vigorous screening for COVID-19 infection and should avoid treatments causing immunosuppression or have their dosages decreased in case of COVID-19 coinfection."],"journal":"Ann Oncol","authors":["Zhang, L","Zhu, F","Xie, L","Wang, C","Wang, J","Chen, R","Jia, P","Guan, H Q","Peng, L","Chen, Y","Peng, P","Zhang, P","Chu, Q","Shen, Q","Wang, Y","Xu, S Y","Zhao, J P","Zhou, M"],"date":"2020-04-01T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32224151","source":"PubMed","week":"202014|Mar 30 - Apr 05","doi":"10.1016/j.annonc.2020.03.296","keywords":["covid-19","cancer","retrospective case study","severe clinical events"],"locations":["Wuhan","China","Wuhan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Diagnosis","Treatment"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138492471607296,"score":216.12965},{"pmid":32301099,"pmcid":"PMC7161094","title":"Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children compared with adults in Shandong Province, China.","text":["Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children compared with adults in Shandong Province, China.","AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak spread in China and is a threat to the world. We reported on the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of children cases to help health workers better understand and provide timely diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Retrospectively, two research centers' case series of 67 consecutive hospitalized cases including 53 adult and 14 children cases with COVID-19 between 23 Jan 2020 and 15 Feb 2020 from Jinan and Rizhao were enrolled in this study. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of children and adults were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Most cases in children were mild (21.4%) and conventional cases (78.6%), with mild clinical signs and symptoms, and all cases were of family clusters. Fever (35.7%) and dry cough (21.4%) were described as clinical manifestations in children cases. Dry cough and phlegm were not the most common symptoms in children compared with adults (p = 0.03).
