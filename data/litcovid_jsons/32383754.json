METHODS: This retrospective study included the first 200 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with COVID-19. The electronic medical records were reviewed at least three weeks after admission. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 200 patients were included (female sex: 102, African American: 102). The median BMI was 30 kg/m(2). The median age was 64 years. Hypertension (76%), hyperlipidemia (46.2%), and diabetes (39.5%) were the three most common comorbidities. Fever (86%), cough (76.5%), and dyspnea (68%) were the three most common symptoms. 24% died during hospitalization (BMI<25 kg/m(2): 31.6%, BMI 25-34 kg/m(2): 17.2%, BMI>/=35 kg/m(2): 34.8%, p= 0.03).
