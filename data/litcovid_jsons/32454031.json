STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective observational study of COVID-19 infected pregnant women (PCR diagnosed), with severe disease (defined per prior publications.(3)). A subset of these cases was previously presented, but without detail on the effect of delivery on disease (London, et al. \"The Relationship Between Status at Presentation and Outcomes Among Pregnant Women with COVID-19\" Am J Perinatol., in press). The study was exempted by IRB. RESULTS: Of 125 confirmed cases of COVID-19, twelve (9.6%) had severe disease (Table 1). Among the 12, three resolved spontaneously after transient respiratory support in hospital and were discharged home (one subsequently returned in preterm labor and delivered by cesarean two weeks later). Of the remaining nine who continued to need respiratory support, seven (77.8%) had iatrogenic preterm deliveries (six by cesarean delivery) for maternal respiratory distress (needing increasing levels of respiratory support without improved oxygen saturation), one had an early term delivery due to PROM, and one, now 30 weeks, has required intensive care with high-flow nasal cannula for three weeks. Of the eight patients delivering with maternal respiratory distress, seven did not require intubation, and one was intubated for emergent cesarean delivery, and remained on a ventilator for 19 days. Among the non-intubated, four had an improvement in oxygenation within two hours postpartum; two required less respiratory support, and two were taken completely off respiratory support. None of the other three required an increased level of respiratory support, and were off of all support between four and seven days postpartum.

Among women not needing a ventilator, return of normal respiratory status after delivery occurred within hours to days. The one patient intubated intraoperatively took longer to recover.

Information regarding infection in pregnancy is still limited. Objectives: To describe the clinical course of severe and critical infection in hospitalized pregnant women with positive laboratory testing for SARS-CoV2. Study Design: This is a cohort study of pregnant women with severe or critical COVID-19 infection hospitalized at 12 US institutions between March 5, 2020 and April 20, 2020. Severe infection was defined according to published criteria by patient reported dyspnea, respiratory rate > 30 per minute, blood oxygen saturation </= 93% on room air, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen <300 and/or lung infiltrates >50% within 24 to 48 hours on chest imaging. Critical disease was defined by respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. Women were excluded if they had presumed COVID-19 infection but laboratory testing was negative. The primary outcome was median duration from hospital admission to discharge. Secondary outcomes included need for supplemental oxygen, intubation, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, death, and timing of delivery. The clinical courses are described by the median disease day on which these outcomes occurred after the onset of symptoms. Treatment and neonatal outcomes are also reported. Results: Of 64 pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19, 44 (69%) had severe and 20 (31%) critical disease. The following pre-existing comorbidities were observed: 25% had a pulmonary condition, 17% had cardiac disease and the mean BMI was 34 kg/m(2). Gestational age at symptom onset was at a mean 29 +/-6 weeks and at hospital admission a mean of 30 +/-6 weeks, on a median day of disease 7 since first symptoms. Eighty-one percent of women were treated with hydroxychloroquine; 9% of women with severe disease and 65% of women with critical disease received remdesivir. All women with critical disease received either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation during their admission. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (6 days for severe, 10.5 days for critical, p=0.01). For those who required it, intubation usually occurred around day 9, and peak respiratory support for women with severe disease occurred on day 8. In women with critical disease, prone positioning was performed in 20% of cases, the rate of ARDS was 70%, and re-intubation was necessary in 20%. There was one case of maternal cardiac arrest, but no cases of cardiomyopathy and no maternal deaths.

Conclusion: In hospitalized pregnant women with severe or critical COVID-19 infection, admission typically occurred about 7 days after symptom onset, and the duration of hospitalization was 6 days (6 severe versus 12 critical).

Two women with COVID-19 breastfed without a mask because infection was diagnosed in the post-partum period: their new-borns tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 infection. In one case a new-born had a positive test after a vaginal operative delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Although post-partum infection cannot be excluded with 100% certainty, these findings suggest that vaginal delivery is associated with a low risk of intrapartum SARS-Cov-2 transmission to the new-born."],"journal":"BJOG","authors":["Ferrazzi, Enrico","Frigerio, Luigi","Savasi, Valeria","Vergani, Patrizia","Prefumo, Federico","Barresi, Santa","Bianchi, Stefano","Ciriello, Elena","Facchinetti, Fabio","Gervasi, Maria Teresa","Iurlaro, Enrico","Kustermann, Alessandra","Mangili, Giovanna","Mosca, Fabio","Patane, Luisa","Spazzini, Donata","Spinillo, Arsenio","Trojano, Giuseppe","Vignali, Michele","Villa, Antonella","Zuccotti, GianVincenzo","Parazzini, Fabio","Cetin, Irene"],"date":"2020-04-28T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32339382","source":"PubMed","week":"202018|Apr 27 - May 03","doi":"10.1111/1471-0528.16278","keywords":["covid-19","delivery","transmission"],"locations":["Italy"],"countries":["Italy"],"countries_codes":["ITA|Italy"],"topics":["Diagnosis","Treatment","Transmission"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138494205952002,"score":236.09656}]}
