In this article, we argue against a blanket interpretation that being labeled \"essential personnel\" means that all in-person ABA services for all clients should continue during the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe this argument holds even if ABA providers are not in a jurisdiction currently under an active shelter-at-home or related order. First, we provide a brief description of risks associated with continued in-person ABA service delivery, as well as risks associated with the temporary suspension of services or the transition to remote ABA service delivery. For many clients, continued in-person service delivery carries a significant risk of severe harm to the client, family and caregivers, staff, and a currently overburdened health care system. In these situations, ABA providers should temporarily suspend services or transition to telehealth or other forms of remote service delivery until information from federal, state, and local health care experts deems in-person contact safe. In rare cases, temporary suspension of services or a transition to remote service delivery may place the client or others at risk of significant harm. In these situations, in-person services should likely continue, and ongoing assessment and risk mitigation are essential.","Behav Anal Pract","Cox, David J","Plavnick, Joshua B","Brodhead, Matthew T","32328220"],"abstract":["Recent executive orders have led some applied behavior analysis (ABA) providers to interpret themselves as \"essential personnel\" during the COVID-19 pandemic.
