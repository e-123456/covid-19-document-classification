Data are limited on the duration and host factors related to viral shedding. METHODS: In this retrospective study, risk factors associated with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA shedding were evaluated in a cohort of 113 symptomatic patients from two hospitals outside Wuhan. RESULTS: The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 17 days (Interquartile Range [IQR], 13-22 days) as measured from illness onset. When comparing patients with early (<15 days) and late viral RNA clearance (>/=15 days after illness onset), prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was associated with male sex (p=0.009), old age (p=0.033), concomitated with hypertension (p=0.009), delayed admission to hospital after illness onset (p=0.001), severe illness at admission (p=0.049), invasive mechanical ventilation (p=0.006), and corticosteroid treatment (p=0.025). Patients with longer SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding duration had slower recovery of body temperature (p<0.001) and focal absorption on radiograph images (p<0.001) than patients with early SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance. Male sex (odds ratio [OR], 3.24 [95% CI, 1.31-8.02]), delayed hospital admission (OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.10-1.54]), and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR, 9.88 [95% CI, 1.11-88.02]) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.
