METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study comparing acute fractures presenting to a single level I pediatric trauma hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic with fractures during a prepandemic period at the same institution. The \"pandemic\" cohort was gathered from March 15 to April 15, 2020 and compared with a \"prepandemic\" cohort from the same time window in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: In total, 1745 patients presenting with acute fractures were included. There was a significant decrease in the incidence of fractures presenting to our practice during the pandemic (22.5+/-9.1/d vs. 9.6+/-5.1/d, P<0.001). The presenting age for all fractures decreased during the pandemic (7.5+/-4.3 vs. 9.4+/-4.4 y, P<0.001) because of decreased fracture burden among adolescents. There were also a decrease in the number of fractures requiring surgery (2.2+/-1.8/d vs. 0.8+/-0.8/d, P<0.001). During the pandemic, there was an increase in the proportion of injuries occurring at home (57.8% vs. 32.5%, P<0.001) or on bicycles (18.3% vs. 8.2%, P<0.001), but a decrease in those related to sports (7.2% vs. 26.0%, P<0.001) or playgrounds (5.2% vs. 9.0%, P<0.001).
