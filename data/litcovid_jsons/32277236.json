There are unique considerations for many adult patients with gliomas who are vulnerable to the novel coronavirus due to older age and immunosuppression. As patients with terminal illnesses, they present ethical challenges for centers that may need to ration access to ventilator care due to insufficient critical care capacity. It is urgent for the neuro-oncology community to develop a pro-active and coordinated approach to the care of adults with gliomas in order to provide them with the best possible oncologic care while also reducing their risk of viral infection during times of potential healthcare system failure. In this article, we present an approach developed by an international multi-disciplinary group to optimize the care of adults with gliomas during this pandemic. We recommend measures to promote strict social distancing and minimize exposures for patients, address risk and benefit of all therapeutic interventions, pro-actively develop end of life plans, educate patients and caregivers and ensure the health of the multi-disciplinary neuro-oncology workforce. This pandemic is already changing neuro-oncologic care delivery around the globe. It is important to highlight opportunities to maximize the benefit and minimize the risk of glioma management during this pandemic and potentially, in the future.","Neuro Oncol","Mohile, Nimish A","Blakeley, Jaishri O","Gatson, Na Tosha N","Hottinger, Andreas F","Lassman, Andrew B","Ney, Douglas E","Olar, Adriana","Schiff, David","Shih, Helen A","Strowd, Roy","van den Bent, Martin J","Ziu, Mateo","32277236"],"abstract":["The COVID-19 outbreak is posing unprecedented risks and challenges for all communities and healthcare systems, worldwide.
