During March 5-14, 2020, four urgent care centers in Santa Clara County participated as sentinel sites. For this investigation, county residents evaluated for respiratory symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) who had no known risk for COVID-19 were identified at participating urgent care centers.

Limitations in effective infection control and prevention and staff members working in multiple facilities contributed to intra- and interfacility spread. COVID-19 can spread rapidly in long-term residential care facilities, and persons with chronic underlying medical conditions are at greater risk for COVID-19-associated severe disease and death. Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to protect the health of residents and preserve the health care workforce by identifying and excluding potentially infected staff members and visitors, ensuring early recognition of potentially infected patients, and implementing appropriate infection control measures."],"journal":"MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep","authors":["McMichael, Temet M","Clark, Shauna","Pogosjans, Sargis","Kay, Meagan","Lewis, James","Baer, Atar","Kawakami, Vance","Lukoff, Margaret D","Ferro, Jessica","Brostrom-Smith, Claire","Riedo, Francis X","Russell, Denny","Hiatt, Brian","Montgomery, Patricia","Rao, Agam K","Currie, Dustin W","Chow, Eric J","Tobolowsky, Farrell","Bardossy, Ana C","Oakley, Lisa P","Jacobs, Jesica R","Schwartz, Noah G","Stone, Nimalie","Reddy, Sujan C","Jernigan, John A","Honein, Margaret A","Clark, Thomas A","Duchin, Jeffrey S"],"date":"2020-03-28T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32214083","week":"202013|Mar 23 - Mar 29","doi":"10.15585/mmwr.mm6912e1","source":"PubMed","locations":["Washington","King County"],"countries":["United States"],"countries_codes":["USA|United States"],"topics":["Prevention"],"weight":1,"_version_":1663352134981124098,"score":279.03503}]}
