Methods: The tracking of all the close contacts of the first COVID-19 case and epidemiological investigation were conducted on January 29, 2020 after a cluster epidemic of COVID-19 related with a Buddhism rally on January 19 (the 1.19 rally) in Ningbo occurred. The swabs of nose/throat of the cases and close contacts were collected and tested for nucleic acids by real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR. Results: From January 26 to February 20, 2020, a total of 67 COVID-19 cases and 15 asymptomatic infection cases related with the 1.19 rally were reported in Ningbo. The initial case was the infection source who infected 29 second generation cases and 4 asymptomatic infection cases, in whom 23 second generation cases and 3 asymptomatic infection cases once took bus with the initial case, the attack rate was 33.82% (23/68) and the infection rate was 38.24% (26/68). The risks of suffering from COVID-19 and being infected were 28.91 times and 26.01 times higher in rally participants taking bus with initial case compared with those taking no bus with initial case. In this epidemic, 37 third+ generation cases and 11 related asymptomatic infection cases occurred, the attack rate was 2.88% (37/1 283) and the infection rate was 4.76% (48/1 008). The main transmission routes included vehicle sharing and family transmission. Conclusion: It was a cluster epidemic of COVID-19 caused by a super spreader in a massive rally. The epidemic has been under effective control.","Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi","Ye, L X","Wang, H B","Lu, H C","Chen, B B","Zhu, Y Y","Gu, S H","Wang, J M","Pan, X X","Fang, T","Dong, H J","32397698"],"abstract":["Objective: To investigate a cluster epidemic of COVID-19 after a mass gathering activity in Ningbo of Zhejiang province and analyze the transmission chain and status of infection cases of different generations.
