Nonparametric statistical tests were used to examine the relationship between the severity of lung disease and the age or sex. RESULTS: 783 Italian patients (532 males and 251 females) with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. The CXR score was significantly higher in males than in females only in groups aged 50 to 79 years.
