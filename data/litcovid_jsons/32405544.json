MATERIAL AND METHODS: The advice of AFU scientific committees in the field of functional urology (neuro-urology, female and perineology, male LUTS) was requested and supplemented by a review of the currently available recommendations on the subject of urology and COVID-19. These opinions were combined to draw up temporary recommendations to help reorganize practices during the epidemic and prepare the post-critical phase. RESULTS: Most of the recommendations available on career-oriented social networks (Twitter, LinkedIn) or in literature concern cancer or general urology. Eight out of ten propose a cancellation of all functional urology procedures without distinction. But the 3 AFU committees covering the field of functional urology have identified three clinical situations in which surgical procedures that can be maintained during the COVID-19 epidemic (priority level A): conclusion of a neuromodulation test in progress (implantation or explantation), botulinum toxin A bladder injections for unbalanced neurologic bladder, cystectomy and ileal conduit for urinary fistula in perineal bedsore or refractory unbalanced neurologic bladder with acute renal failure and vesico-enteric or prostato-pubic fistulas. Management adaptation of the other pathologies are proposed, as well as the application of 3 priority levels (B, C, D) for rescheduled procedures for a better management of the post-crisis activity resumption.

RESULTS: Our team developed the following general recommendations for urologic interventions on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients: maximize use of telehealth (even for inpatient consults), minimize in-room time, use personal protective equipment appropriately, enlist a colleague to assist, and acquire all supplies that may be needed and maintain them outside the room.

This pathway seeks to outline a urology patient care strategy that reduces the transmission risk to both healthcare providers and patients, reduces the healthcare burden, and maintains appropriate patient care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consultations to the urology service during a 3-week period (March 16 to April 2, 2020) were triaged and managed via one of 3 pathways: Standard, Telemedicine, or High-Risk. Standard consults were in-person consults with non COVID-19 patients, High-Risk consults were in-person consults with COVID-19 positive/suspected patients, and Telemedicine consults were telephonic consults for low-acuity urologic issues in either group of patients. Patient demographics, consultation parameters and consultation outcomes were compared to consultations from the month of March 2019. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square test and continuous variables using Mann-Whitney U test. A P value <.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Between March 16 and April 2, 2020, 53 inpatient consultations were performed. By following our triage pathway, a total of 19/53 consultations (35.8%) were performed via Telemedicine with no in-person exposure, 10/53 consultations (18.9%) were High-Risk, in which we strictly controlled the urology team member in-person contact, and the remainder, 24/53 consultations (45.2%), were performed as Standard in-person encounters.
