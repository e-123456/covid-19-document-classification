This study assessed the value of the PDCA cycle in standardizing nursing management in an intensive care unit (ICU) for patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: The status quo of the ICU was analyzed, and the relevant issues and countermeasures were proposed. The PDCA cycle was applied to standardize the nursing management in the ICU. RESULTS: Nine measures were proposed and applied to improve the management of the COVID-19 ICU: defining the clean or contaminated areas, use of self-designed shoe storage cabinets, defining staff roles and responsibilities, establishing the staffing structure, staff training, placing items at fixed locations, improving shift handover, use of bulletin boards for listing key points, and use of reserved drugs cabinets. The virus contamination awareness, professional skills, awareness of duties and responsibilities, and quality and performance of nursing were remarkably improved 2 weeks after the implementation of the above countermeasures.

One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied.

OBJECTIVE: This study focused on satisfaction of ICU staff with the current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects disturbing patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff is willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further desired to uncover differences in the responses of the professional groups. METHODS: This survey study was realized with ICU staff from four ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff about clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and Chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. RESULTS: Eighty-six of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated to feel confident using the patient monitoring, but high rates of false positive alarms and the many sensor cables were considered to disturb patient care. Wireless sensors, reduction of false positive alarms and hospital standard operating procedures (SOP) for alarm management were demanded. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were split. Regarding its use, most respondents indicated responsibility for multiple wards or earlier alerting. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and increased risk of mortality, as well as to have guidelines for therapy and diagnostics proposed. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote usage of an AI. The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for ICU and desired more time for it. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about using mobile phones for remote monitoring, and AI-based intelligent alarm management. CONCLUSIONS: This survey study among ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm SOPs, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing digital literacy of ICU staff.

RESULTS: The 191 ICUs in Australia provide 2378 intensive care beds during baseline activity (9.3 ICU beds per 100 000 population). Of the 175 ICUs that responded to the surge survey (with 2228 intensive care beds), a maximal surge would add an additional 4258 intensive care beds (191% increase) and 2631 invasive ventilators (120% increase).
