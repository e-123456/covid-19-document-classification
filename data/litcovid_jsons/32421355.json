MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated glycemic control of individuals with T1DM using HCL system in the period before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy (February 10th - 23rd, 2020 - Time 1), when movements were only reduced (February 24th - March 8th, 2020 - Time 2) and during complete lockdown (March 9th-22nd, 2020 - Time 3). Information about regular PA (at least 3 hours per week) prior and during the quarantine were collected. RESULTS: The study included 13 individuals with a median age of 14.2 years and a good glycemic control at baseline (GMI 7%, TIR 68%, TBR 2%). All individuals continued to show good glycemic control throughout the study period. There was an increase in TIR during the study period (+3%) and TIR was significantly higher in Time 3 (72%) than in Time 2 (66%). TBR was significantly lower in Time 3 (1%) both compared to Time 1 and Time 2 (2%). A meaningful variance in TIR at Time 3 between individuals who performed or not PA during quarantine and a significant increase in TIR between Time 2 and Time 3 both in individuals doing PA at baseline and during quarantine, was found. At logistic regression, only the presence of PA during quarantine significantly predicted a TIR >70 %. CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic control of T1DM in adolescents using HCL system did not worsen during the restrictions due to COVID-19 pandemics and further improved in those who continued physical activity during the quarantine. Maintaining regular physical activity in a safe home environment is an essential strategy for young individuals with T1DM during the COVID-19 crisis.","Diabetes Technol Ther","Tornese, Gianluca","Ceconi, Viola","Monasta, Lorenzo","Carletti, Claudia","Faleschini, Elena","Barbi, Egidio","32421355"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: In order to limit the spread of COVID-19, governments have ordered a series of restrictions that may affect glycemic control in individuals with T1DM, since physical activity (PA) was not allowed outside home.

There is no information about the effects of tight glycemic control on Covid-19 outcomes in patients with hyperglycemia. Therefore, we examined the effects of optimal glycemic control in patients with hyperglycemia affected by Covid-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with Covid-19 hospitalized with moderate disease were evaluated. On the basis of admission glycemia >7.77 mmol/L, patients were divided into hyperglycemic and normoglycemic groups. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and D-dimer levels were evaluated at admission and weekly during hospitalization. The composite end point was severe disease, admission to an intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: Thirty-four (57.6%) patients were normoglycemic and 25 (42.4%) were hyperglycemic. In the hyperglycemic group, 7 (28%) and 18 (72%) patients were diagnosed with diabetes already before admission, and 10 (40%) and 15 (60%) were treated without and with insulin infusion, respectively. The mean of glycemia during hospitalization was 10.65 +/- 0.84 mmol/L in the no insulin infusion group and 7.69 +/- 1.85 mmol/L in the insulin infusion group. At baseline, IL-6 and D-dimer levels were significantly higher in the hyperglycemic group than in the normoglycemic group (P < 0.001). Despite that all patients were on standard treatment for Covid-19 infection, IL-6 and D-dimer levels persisted higher in patients with hyperglycemia during hospitalization.
