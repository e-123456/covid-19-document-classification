METHODS: We acquired information and data on the general information, infection and death status of health care workers in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak and completed statistical analyses. RESULTS: We have obtained the data on 2,457 infected cases among health care workers in Wuhan, China. More than half of the infected individuals were nurses (52.06%), while 33.62% of infected cases were doctors and 14.33% of cases were medical staff. In particular, the case infection rate of nurses (2.22%) was remarkably higher than that of doctors (1.92%). Most infected cases among health care workers were female (72.28%). A majority of the infected health care workers (89.26%) came from general hospitals, followed by specialized hospitals (5.70%) and community hospitals (5.05%). The case infection rate of health care workers (2.10%) was dramatically higher than that of non-health care workers (0.43%). The case fatality rate of health care workers (0.69%) was significantly lower than that of non-health care workers (5.30%). CONCLUSIONS: The infection risk of HCWs is clearly higher than that of non-HCWs. HCWs play an essential role in fighting the pandemic. The analysis of the infection status of HCWs is essential to attract enough attention from the public, provide effective suggestions for government agencies and improve protective measures for HCWs.","Clin Infect Dis","Zheng, Lichun","Wang, Xiang","Zhou, Chongchong","Liu, Qin","Li, Shuang","Sun, Qin","Wang, Mengjia","Zhou, Qian","Wang, Wenmei","32409825"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Health care workers at the frontline are facing a substantial risk of infection during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.

A poor understanding of the disease among health care workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and result in the rapid spread of the infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables, with significance set to P<.05. RESULTS: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% (n=234) were male, 32.1% (n=147) were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (n=137, 30.2%) and medical students (n=134, 29.6%).

Factors such as age and profession were associated with inadequate knowledge and a poor perception of COVID-19.
