While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyles at home is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020, in seven languages, to elucidate the behavioural and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours. METHODS: Following a structured review of the literature, the \"Effects of home Confinement on multiple Lifestyle Behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak (ECLB-COVID19)\" Electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics. The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform. Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and Slovenian languages. Questions were presented in a differential format, with questions related to responses \"before\" and \"during\" confinement conditions. RESULTS: 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis. The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all PA intensity levels (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall). Additionally, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 h per day. Food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of main meals) were more unhealthy during confinement, with only alcohol binge drinking decreasing significantly. CONCLUSION: While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a health compromising direction. A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups, which will help develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviours that have manifested during the COVID-19 confinement.","Nutrients","Ammar, Achraf","Brach, Michael","Trabelsi, Khaled","Chtourou, Hamdi","Boukhris, Omar","Masmoudi, Liwa","Bouaziz, Bassem","Bentlage, Ellen","How, Daniella","Ahmed, Mona","Muller, Patrick","Muller, Notger","Aloui, Asma","Hammouda, Omar","Paineiras-Domingos, Laisa Liane","Braakman-Jansen, Annemarie","Wrede, Christian","Bastoni, Sofia","Pernambuco, Carlos Soares","Mataruna, Leonardo","Taheri, Morteza","Irandoust, Khadijeh","Khacharem, Aimen","Bragazzi, Nicola L","Chamari, Karim","Glenn, Jordan M","Bott, Nicholas T","Gargouri, Faiez","Chaari, Lotfi","Batatia, Hadj","Ali, Gamal Mohamed","Abdelkarim, Osama","Jarraya, Mohamed","Abed, Kais El","Souissi, Nizar","Van Gemert-Pijnen, Lisette","Riemann, Bryan L","Riemann, Laurel","Moalla, Wassim","Gomez-Raja, Jonathan","Epstein, Monique","Sanderman, Robbert","Schulz, Sebastian Vw","Jerg, Achim","Al-Horani, Ramzi","Mansi, Taiysir","Jmail, Mohamed","Barbosa, Fernando","Ferreira-Santos, Fernando","Simunic, Bostjan","Pisot, Rado","Gaggioli, Andrea","Bailey, Stephen J","Steinacker, Jurgen M","Driss, Tarak","Hoekelmann, Anita","32481594"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Public health recommendations and governmental measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in numerous restrictions on daily living including social distancing, isolation and home confinement.

In this period of quarantine, one of the reasons for going out is physical activity. This issue is important, as the impact of a sedentary lifestyle might be lower for children and young adults, but is far more severe for older adults. Although older adults need to stay at home because they have a higher risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), they need to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. Physical activity is important for older adults, especially to maintain their level of independence, mental health, and well-being. Maintaining mobility in old age is necessary, as it may predict loss of independence in older adults. OBJECTIVE: Our first objective was to evaluate the impact of this quarantine period on physical activity programs and on the physical and mental health of older adults. Our second objective was to discuss alternatives to physical activity programs that could be suggested for this population to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative survey using semistructured interviews with professionals (managers in charge of physical activity programs for older adults and sports trainers who run these physical activity programs) from the French Federation of Physical Education and Voluntary Gymnastics (FFPEVG) and older adults participating in a physical activity program of the FFPEVG. We followed a common interview guide. For analysis, we carried out a thematic analysis of the interviews. RESULTS: This study suggests that the COVID-19 epidemic has affected, before quarantine measures, the number of seniors attending group physical activity programs in the two study territories. In addition, despite the decline in their participation in group physical activities before the quarantine, older adults expressed the need to perform physical activity at home. There is a need to help older adults integrate simple and safe ways to stay physically active in a limited space. A national policy to support older adults for physical activity at home appears essential in this context. CONCLUSIONS: Given the results of our study, it seems necessary to globally communicate how important it is for older adults to maintain physical activity at home. We are concerned about the level of independence and mental health state of older adults after the end of quarantine if there is no appropriate campaign to promote physical activity among them at home.","JMIR Aging","Goethals, Luc","Barth, Nathalie","Guyot, Jessica","Hupin, David","Celarier, Thomas","Bongue, Bienvenu","32356777"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Older adults and those with pre-existing medical conditions are at risk of death from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2).
