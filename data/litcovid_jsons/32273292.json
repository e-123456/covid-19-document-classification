Previous studies mainly focused on Wuhan and typical symptoms. We analysed 74 confirmed COVID-19 cases with GI symptoms in the Zhejiang province to determine epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics. DESIGN: COVID-19 hospital patients were admitted in the Zhejiang province from 17 January 2020 to 8 February 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management and outcome data of patients with GI symptoms were analysed using multivariate analysis for risk of severe/critical type. Bioinformatics were used to analyse features of SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province. RESULTS: Among enrolled 651 patients, 74 (11.4%) presented with at least one GI symptom (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea), average age of 46.14 years, 4-day incubation period and 10.8% had pre-existing liver disease. Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 17 (22.97%) and 23 (31.08%) had severe/critical types and family clustering, respectively, significantly higher than those without GI symptoms, 47 (8.14%) and 118 (20.45%). Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 29 (39.19%), 23 (31.08%), 8 (10.81%) and 16 (21.62%) had significantly higher rates of fever >38.5 degrees C, fatigue, shortness of breath and headache, respectively. Low-dose glucocorticoids and antibiotics were administered to 14.86% and 41.89% of patients, respectively. Sputum production and increased lactate dehydrogenase/glucose levels were risk factors for severe/critical type. Bioinformatics showed sequence mutation of SARS-CoV-2 with m(6)A methylation and changed binding capacity with ACE2. CONCLUSION: We report COVID-19 cases with GI symptoms with novel features outside Wuhan. Attention to patients with COVID-19 with non-classic symptoms should increase to protect health providers.","Gut","Jin, Xi","Lian, Jiang-Shan","Hu, Jian-Hua","Gao, Jianguo","Zheng, Lin","Zhang, Yi-Min","Hao, Shao-Rui","Jia, Hong-Yu","Cai, Huan","Zhang, Xiao-Li","Yu, Guo-Dong","Xu, Kai-Jin","Wang, Xiao-Yan","Gu, Jue-Qing","Zhang, Shan-Yan","Ye, Chan-Yuan","Jin, Ci-Liang","Lu, Ying-Feng","Yu, Xia","Yu, Xiao-Peng","Huang, Jian-Rong","Xu, Kang-Li","Ni, Qin","Yu, Cheng-Bo","Zhu, Biao","Li, Yong-Tao","Liu, Jun","Zhao, Hong","Zhang, Xuan","Yu, Liang","Guo, Yong-Zheng","Su, Jun-Wei","Tao, Jing-Jing","Lang, Guan-Jing","Wu, Xiao-Xin","Wu, Wen-Rui","Qv, Ting-Ting","Xiang, Dai-Rong","Yi, Ping","Shi, Ding","Chen, Yanfei","Ren, Yue","Qiu, Yun-Qing","Li, Lan-Juan","Sheng, Jifang","Yang, Yida","32213556"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: The SARS-CoV-2-infected disease (COVID-19) outbreak is a major threat to human beings.
