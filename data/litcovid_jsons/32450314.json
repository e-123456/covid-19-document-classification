OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study are to report the load and variety of emergent/urgent neurosurgical cases after implementing the 'Battle Plan' at an academic tertiary referral center during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare these variables to previous practice at the same institution. METHODS: The clinical data of all patients who underwent a neurosurgical intervention between March 23, 2020 and April 20, 2020 was obtained from a prospectively maintained database. Data of the control group was retrospectively collected from the medical records to compare the types of surgeries/interventions performed by the same neurosurgical service before the COVID-19 pandemic started. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients underwent emergent, urgent and essential neurosurgical interventions over a 4-week period during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient screening at teleclinics identified 11 urgent surgical cases. The implementation of the 'Battle Plan' led to a significant decrease in the case load, and the variation of cases by subspecialty is evident when compared to a control group comprised of 214 patients. CONCLUSION: Delivery of optimal care and safe practice and education at an academic neurosurgical department can be well maintained with proper execution of crisis protocols.
