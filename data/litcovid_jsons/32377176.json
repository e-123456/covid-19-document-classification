Currently, management of patients with pancreatic cancer has been complicated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Medical oncologists face the dilemma of whether to treat or to not treat these patients who are at high-risk of complications and even death from COVID-19. No current guidelines are available and our limited experience at this time makes it more difficult to manage these patients.

Delay requirements were statistically more frequent among patients with prostate or breast cancer compared with those with lung or pancreatic cancer. Actions taken by oncologists are also reported.
