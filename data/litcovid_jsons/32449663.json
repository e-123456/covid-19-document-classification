METHODS: A review of selected key reports, papers and publications related to epidemics and pandemics in Irish history was conducted. RESULTS: Viruses, epidemics and pandemics are recurring features of human history. Early Irish sources record a broad array of plagues, pandemics and epidemics including bubonic plague, typhus, cholera, dysentery and smallpox, as well as an alleged epidemic of insanity in the 19th century (that never truly occurred). Like the Spanish flu pandemic (1918-20), COVID-19 (a new coronavirus) presents both the challenge of the illness itself and the problems caused by the anxiety that the virus triggers. Managing this anxiety has always been a challenge, especially with the Spanish flu. People with mental illness had particularly poor outcomes with the Spanish flu, often related to the large, unhygienic mental hospitals in which so many were housed. CONCLUSIONS: Even today, a full century after the Spanish flu pandemic, people with mental illness remain at increased risk of poor physical health, so it is imperative that multi-disciplinary care continues during the current outbreak of COVID-19, despite the manifest difficulties involved.

RESULTS: The positive percent agreement was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.97) for Abbott ID NOW and 100% (95% CI, 0.90-1.00) for DiaSorin Simplexa and Roche cobas.
