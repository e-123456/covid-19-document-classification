A solid communication strategy is needed to increase the reach of valid information to health professionals, reduce misinformation, and efficiently implement recommended measures. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to describe the utilization of a dedicated mHealth platform to disseminate up-to-date and validated information about the SARS-CoV-2 to all medical staff of the Children's Hospital at the University Hospitals of Geneva. METHODS: Three documents containing institutional information concerning screening, local containment procedures as well as FAQ for parents were made available to the staff through a mobile application developed in the University of Geneva, Switzerland. Using a third-party statistics tool, we anonymously monitored user activity as well as content utilization patterns since the diagnostic of the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland on February 25, 2020. RESULTS: During the period of February 25 to March 13, 2020 (18 days) information documents on SARS-CoV-2 were viewed 859 times which amounted for 35.6% of total content views. User activity increased significantly with 50.8 (SD = 14.4) vs 26.4 (SD = 9.8) users per day comparing to previous weeks (p < 0.001). In addition, sessions number per day more than doubled during mentioned period (p < 0.001). In a survey medical staff found the information easy to find within the application. On a 10 point Likert-scale the ability of the application to reassure staff in clinical practice was rated 7.6 (SD = 2.1), time-saving ability was rated 8.5/10 (SD = 2.1) and the need to look for information from other sources was rated with a score of 5.9/10 (SD = 3.3). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a mHealth solution to disseminate novel coronavirus related information seemed to be an effective and timesaving communication channel within our institution during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Medical staff felt reassured and informed in daily practice. More research should be done concerning the clinical impact and outcomes of the integration of mHealth solutions as a communication channel of validated information within health institutions.","JMIR Public Health Surveill","Zamberg, Ido","Manzano, Sergio","Posfay-Barbe, Klara","Windisch, Olivier","Agoritsas, Thomas","Schiffer, Eduardo","32250958"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: As part of response plans for current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, authorities are drafting and implementing containment measures across jurisdictions worldwide in the effort to slow transmission and infection rate.

Contact tracing using smartphone technology is a powerful tool which may be employed to limit disease transmission during an epidemic or pandemic, yet contact tracing applications present with significant privacy concerns regarding the collection of personal data such as location. OBJECTIVE: To provide an effective contact tracing smartphone application that respects user privacy by not collecting location information or other personal data. METHODS: We propose the use of an anonymized graph of interpersonal interactions to conduct a novel form of contact tracing, and develop a proof-of-concept smartphone application which implements this approach. Additionally, we develop a computer simulation model which demonstrates the impact of our proposal on epidemic or pandemic outbreak trajectories across multiple rates of adoption. RESULTS: Our proof-of-concept smartphone application allows users to create \"checkpoints\" for contact tracing, check their risk level based on their past interactions, and anonymously self-report a positive status to their peer network. Our simulation results suggest that higher adoption rates of such an application may result in a better controlled epidemic or pandemic outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed smartphone-based contact tracing method presents a novel solution which preserves privacy while demonstrating the potential to suppress an epidemic or pandemic outbreak.
