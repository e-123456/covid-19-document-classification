Thrombocytopenia in patients with COVID-19 has not been fully studied. OBJECTIVE: To describe thrombocytopenia in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: For each of 1476 consecutive patients with COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China, nadir platelet count during hospitalization was retrospectively collected and categorized into (0, 50], (50, 100], (100 - 150] or (150 - ) group after taking the unit (x 10(9/L) ) away from the report of nadir platelet count. Nadir platelet counts and in-hospital mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: Among all patients, 238 (16.1%) patients deceased and 306 (20.7%) had thrombocytopenia. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older, were more likely to have thrombocytopenia and had lower nadir platelet counts. The in-hospital mortality was 92.1%, 61.2%, 17.5% and 4.7% for (0, 50], (50, 100], (100 - 150] and (150 - ) group, respectively. With (150 - ) as the reference, nadir platelet counts of (100 - 150], (50, 100] and (0, 50] group had a relative risk of 3.42 (95% CI 2.36 - 4.96), 9.99 (95% CI 7.16 - 13.94) and 13.68 (95% CI 9.89 - 18.92), respectively.
