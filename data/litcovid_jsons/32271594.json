Starting in December 2019 from China, the first cases were officially announced on February 19 in Qom city, Iran. As of April 3, 2020, 206 countries have reported a total of 932166 cases with 46764 deaths. Along with China, USA, Italy, Spain, and Germany, Iran has been suffering the hardest burden of COVID-19 outbreak. Worse still, countries like Iran are struggling with the double burden of political sanctions to provide lifesaving medical equipment and medicines to combat the emergency. METHODS: Using systematic document content analysis and through the lenses of health policy triangle, this article aims to compare the policies and strategies that Iran is adopting, with the experience and recommendations of China and WHO to combat COVID-19. RESULTS: Iran has formulated contextual-based policies to combat COVID-19 outbreak before and after virus entrance. Insufficient whole-government, whole-society approach in managing the outbreak, inadequate lifesaving and protective equipment, and delayed decisive governance are the biggest challenges in policy making to combat COVID-19. COVID-19 policies are a public health concern and require professional advocacy attempts through appropriate inter-sectoral collaboration and whole-government coalitions. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is an unfolding outbreak; hence, policy learning is crucial to formulate appropriate policies and implement them accordingly. Iran has made many efforts to defeat the outbreak, but more coherent, timely and efficient action is required, now, more than ever, to save lives and slow the spread of this pandemic.","Arch Iran Med","Raoofi, Azam","Takian, Amirhossein","Akbari Sari, Ali","Olyaeemanesh, Alireza","Haghighi, Hajar","Aarabi, Mohsen","32271594"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic.

The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 24, 2020 were investigated and prediction was made until April 15, 2020. METHODS: By estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, time-dependent recovery rate, and timedependent death rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package. RESULTS: Based on our predictions of Iran about 29000 people will be infected from March 25 to April 15, 2020. On average, 1292 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran.
