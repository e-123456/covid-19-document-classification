METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. FINDINGS: Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts [0.6 (0.6-0.8)] but increases in neutrophil counts [4.7 (3.6-5.8)] than 27 mild cases [1.1 (0.8-1.4); 2.0 (1.5-2.9)]. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8(+) T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-gamma levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases.
