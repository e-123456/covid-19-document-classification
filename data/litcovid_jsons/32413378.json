There has been a drastic decrease in liver donors. From February 23(rd) until April 10th, 17 LTs were performed in Lombardy. Mean donor age was 49 years (range 18-74) whereas mean recipient age was 55 (13-69); mean MELD Score was 12 (6-24). All donors underwent screening for SARS CoV-2 prior to LT. Two patients tested positive after LT, and one patient died for COVID on POD 30. 16 patients are alive after an average of 30 days post LT (range 3-46). 10 patients have been discharged.
