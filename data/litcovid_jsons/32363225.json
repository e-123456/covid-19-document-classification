METHODS: We describe 6 otherwise healthy adolescents - 3 siblings per family from 2 unrelated families - presented within a 48-hour period in April, 2020, with acral perniosis-like lesions in the context of over 30 similar patients who were evaluated within the same week. RESULTS: Affected patients had mild symptoms of viral upper respiratory infection (URI) or contact with symptomatic persons 1-2 weeks preceding the rash. They all presented with red to violaceous macules and dusky, purpuric plaques scattered on the mid and distal aspects of the toes. Skin biopsies performed on each of the 6 patients demonstrated near identical histopathologic findings to those of idiopathic perniosis, with a lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate without evidence of thromboembolism or immune complex vasculitis. While SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction was negative, testing was performed 1-2 weeks after URI symptoms or sick contact exposure. CONCLUSION: We offer a clinical approach to evaluation of patients with this presentation and discuss the possibility that these skin findings represent a convalescent-phase cutaneous reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Pediatr Dermatol","Cordoro, Kelly M","Reynolds, Sean D","Wattier, Rachel","McCalmont, Timothy H","32396999"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: There has been a recent marked increase in pediatric and adult patients presenting with purpuric acral lesions concerning for ischemia, thrombosis and necrosis in COVID-19 prevalent regions worldwide.
