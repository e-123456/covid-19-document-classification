Thematic analysis to elucidate ''the what and why'' of anatomy education was applied to these reflections. Eighteen anatomy academics from ten institutions participated in this exercise.

The key opportunities recognized for anatomy education included: enabling synchronous teaching across remote sites, expanding offerings into the remote learning space, and embracing new pedagogies. In managing anatomy education's transition in response to the pandemic, six critical elements were identified: community care, clear communications, clarified expectations, constructive alignment, community of practice, ability to compromise and adapt and continuity planning.
