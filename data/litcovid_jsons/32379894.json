MATERIAL AND METHOD: 186 patients with PCR confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in this study. Age, gender, blood groups, comorbidities, need for intubation and intensive care unit follow up and mortalities of the patients were analyzed retrospectively. 1881 healthy individuals, who presented to the Hacettepe University Blood Bank served as the controls. RESULTS: The most frequently detected blood group was blood group A (57%) amongst the COVID-19 patients. This was followed by the blood group O (24.8%).
