RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, there is no structured framework for urology residency programs to adhere to in the face of a global pandemic or natural disaster. Urologic surgical emergencies arise and exceptional urologic care must continue to be provided. Despite lower surgical volumes and the inability for teams to meet in person, there are still robust opportunities for urologic surgical residents and faculty to maintain their surgical skills and mental sharpness. Changes within the medical field are already beginning to take shape, especially related to telehealth and virtual learning.
