The body temperatures of the patients were normal at admission without fever or cough in the past 2 weeks. At admission, chest CT of one patient showed double lower lobes and left upper lobes had multiple slices and slightly high-density shadow of nodules. Chest CT of two patients showed bilateral lung texture was thickening, and chest CT of other patients was normal.
