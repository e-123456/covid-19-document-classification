There is controversy regarding risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. It has been suggested that asthma and allergy are not highly represented as co-morbid conditions associated with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To extend our work in interleukin (IL)-13 biology to determine if airway epithelial cell expression of two key mediators critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) are modulated by IL-13. METHODS: We determined effects of IL-13 treatment on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression ex vivo in primary airway epithelial cells from participants with and without type 2 asthma obtained by bronchoscopy. We also examined expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in two datasets containing gene expression data from nasal and airway epithelial cells from children and adults with asthma and allergic rhinitis. RESULTS: IL-13 significantly reduced ACE2 and increased TMPRSS2 expression ex vivo in airway epithelial cells. In two independent datasets, ACE2 expression was significantly reduced and TMPRSS2 was significantly increased in the nasal and airway epithelial cells in type 2 asthma and allergic rhinitis. ACE2 expression was significantly negatively associated with type 2 cytokines while TMPRSS2 expression was significantly positively associated with type 2 cytokines. CONCLUSION: IL-13 modulates ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in airway epithelial cells in asthma.

The first step in SARS-CoV-2 infection is binding of the virus to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the airway epithelium. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to gain insight into the expression of ACE2 in the human airway epithelium. METHODS: Airway epithelium sampled by fiberoptic bronchoscopy of trachea, large airway epi-thelium (LAE) and small airway epithelium (SAE) of nonsmokers and smokers was analyzed for expression of ACE2 and other coronavirus infection-related genes using microarray, RNA-seq and 10x single cell transcriptome analysis, with associated examination of ACE2-related miRNA. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: (1) ACE2 is expressed similarly in the trachea and LAE with lower expression in the SAE; (2) in the SAE, ACE2 is expressed in basal, intermediate, club, mu-cus and ciliated cells; (3) ACE2 is up-regulated in the SAE by smoking, significantly in males; (4) levels of miR-1246 expression could play a role in ACE2 up-regulation in the SAE of smokers; and (5) ACE2 is expressed in airway epithelium differentiated in vitro on air-liquid interface cultures from primary airway basal stem/progenitor cells; this can be replicated using LAE and SAE immortalized basal cell lines derived from healthy nonsmokers.
