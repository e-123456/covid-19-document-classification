At the time of writing this article (April 2020), the world is drastically influenced by the COVID-19. Recently the COVID-19 open research dataset (CORD-19) was published. For researchers on intellectual disability such as ourselves, it is of key interest to learn whether this open research dataset may be used to investigate the virus and its consequences for people with an intellectual disability. METHODS: From CORD-19 we identified full text articles containing terms related to the intellectual disability-care and applied a text mining technique, specifically the TF-IDF analysis in combination with K-means clustering. RESULTS: 259 articles contained one or more of our specified terms related to intellectual disability. We were able to cluster these articles related to intellectual disabilities into five clusters on different topics, namely: Mental health, Viral diseases, Diagnoses & Treatments, Maternal care & Pediatrics, and Genetics. CONCLUSION: The CORD-19 open research dataset consists of valuable information about not only COVID-19 disease but also intellectual disabilities and the relationship between them. We suggest researchers investigate Literature-Based Discovery approaches on the CORD-19 and develop a new dataset that addresses the intersection of these two fields for further research.","J Intellect Disabil Res","Tummers, J","Catal, C","Tobi, H","Tekinerdogan, B","Leusink, G","32307762"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been announced as a new coronavirus disease by the World Health Organization (WHO).
