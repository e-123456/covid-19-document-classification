A 59-year-old woman was admitted to the isolated ward for severe type of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia. At the time of admission, her platelet count was in a normal range. Two days later, her platelet count decreased gradually without any signs or symptoms of bleeding. Since the peripheral blood smear showed a platelet aggregation, a blood sample anticoagulanted with citrate was tested and the number of platelet was normal.

Methods: We closely tracked the epidemiological history, diagnosis and treatment process, as well as dynamic changes in routine blood indicators, of a severe COVID-19 patient who was hospitalized for 26 days. Results: Our study found that the patient's condition worsened in the first week after admission; white blood cells (WBCs), neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelets (PLT) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) decreased. On the 7th day of admission, the levels of these cells decreased to their lowest values, though the red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level remained at high values.
