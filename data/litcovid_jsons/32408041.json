There was a substantial reduction in the level of nitrogen dioxide (NO2: 0.00002 mol m(-2)), a low reduction in CO (<0.03 mol m(-2)), and a low-to-moderate reduction in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD: ~0.1-0.2) in the major hotspots of COVID-19 outbreak during February-March 2020, which may be attributed to the mass lockdowns. Our study projects an increasing coverage of high COVID-19 hazard at absolute humidity levels ranging from 4 to 9 g m(-3) across a large part of the globe during April-July 2020 due to a high prospective meteorological suitability for COVID-19 spread.
