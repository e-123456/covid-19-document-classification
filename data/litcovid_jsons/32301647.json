In the subgroup of RT-PCR-positive and CT-positive patients, ground-glass opacities (GGO) were present in 58/58 (100%), multilobe and posterior involvement were both present in 54/58 (93%), bilateral pneumonia in 53/58 (91%), and subsegmental vessel enlargement (> 3 mm) in 52/58 (89%) of study participants. Conclusion The typical pattern of COVID-19 pneumonia in Rome, Italy, was peripherally ground-glass opacities with multilobe and posterior involvement, bilateral distribution, and subsegmental vessel enlargement (> 3 mm). Chest CT sensitivity was high (97%) but with lower specificity (56%)."],"journal":"Radiology","authors":["Caruso, Damiano","Zerunian, Marta","Polici, Michela","Pucciarelli, Francesco","Polidori, Tiziano","Rucci, Carlotta","Guido, Gisella","Bracci, Benedetta","de Dominicis, Chiara","Laghi, Andrea"],"date":"2020-04-04T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32243238","week":"202014|Mar 30 - Apr 05","doi":"10.1148/radiol.2020201237","source":"PubMed","locations":["lymphocytopenia","128/158","95/158","Italy","Rome"],"countries":["Italy"],"countries_codes":["ITA|Italy"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1663352135792721921,"score":346.36768}]}
