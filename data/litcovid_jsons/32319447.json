This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk. Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections. Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not. Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration. To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d. The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L). For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D3 doses might be useful.

The suggestion is based on the hypothesis that ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may favor the entry and diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus into the human cells. ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may increase the expression of ACE2 receptors, which are the sites of viral entry into the human organism. ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous, although they are extremely abundant on the cell surface of type 2 pneumocytes. Type 2 pneumocytes are small cylindrical alveolar cells located in close vicinity to pulmonary capillaries and responsible for the synthesis of alveolar surfactant, which is known to facilitate gas exchanges. The increased expression of ACE2 for effect of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs can be detected by increased production of angiotensin1-7 and mRNA related to ACE2. There is the fear that the increased expression of ACE2 induced by ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may ultimately facilitate the entry and diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, there is no clinical evidence to support this hypothesis. Furthermore, available data are conflicting and some counter-intuitive findings suggest that ARBs may be beneficial, not harmful. Indeed, studies conducted in different laboratories demonstrated that ACE2 receptors show a down-regulation (i.e. the opposite of what would happen with ACE-inhibitors and ARBs) for effect of their interaction with the virus. In animal studies, down-regulation of ACE2 has been found as prevalent in the pulmonary areas infected by virus, but not in the surrounding areas. In these studies, virus-induced ACE2 down-regulation would lead to a reduced formation of angiotensin1-7 (because ACE2 degrades angiotensin II into angiotensin1-7) with consequent accumulation of angiotensin II. The excess angiotensin II would favor pulmonary edema and inflammation, a phenomenon directly associated with angiotensin II levels, along with worsening in pulmonary function. Such detrimental effects have been blocked by ARBs in experimental models. In the light of the above considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that the suggestion to discontinue ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in all patients with the aim of preventing or limiting the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus is not based on clinical evidence. Conversely, experimental studies suggest that ARBs might be useful in these patients to limit pulmonary damage through the inhibition of type 1 angiotensin II receptors.
