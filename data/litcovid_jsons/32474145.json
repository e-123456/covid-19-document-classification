METHODS: We evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital. RESULTS: We studied 184 ICU patients with proven COVID-19 pneumonia of whom 23 died (13%), 22 were discharged alive (12%) and 139 (76%) were still on the ICU on April 5th 2020. All patients received at least standard doses thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome was 31% (95%CI 20-41), of which CTPA and/or ultrasonography confirmed VTE in 27% (95%CI 17-37%) and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7% (95%CI 0-8.2%).

Thoracic ultrasound showed signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia and the Sars-Cov-2 swab was positive. Antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin treatment were initiated. Due to the progressive impairment of respiratory function, the patient was intubated after eight days from the admission. The day after he showed signs of bilateral acute limb ischemia. A duplex ultrasound demonstrated the complete thrombosis of the aortic graft without flow at the femoral level. An urgent angio-computed tomography (CT) scan for revascularization purpose was requested, but the patient died upon the arrival in radiological suite.
