The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear. This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence. METHODS: The clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients' oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed. Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs. The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed. RESULTS: In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0-62.0) years were analyzed. After in-hospital treatment, patients' inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition. The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0-11.0) days. By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients' stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0-16.0) days after symptom onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0-4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients' urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression model (F = 2.669, P = 0.044, and adjusted R = 0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients' stools (t = -2.699, P = 0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, respectively; t = 2.550, P = 0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; t = 4.631, P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence.

Alanine transaminase (ALT) (22.00 [15.00, 34.00] U/L vs. 18.70 [13.00, 30.38] U/L, Z = 2.592, P = 0.010), aspartate transaminase (AST) (34.00 [27.00, 47.00] U/L vs. 22.00 [17.65, 31.75] U/L, Z = 7.308, P < 0.001), and creatinine levels (89.00 [72.00, 133.50] mumol/L vs.65.00 [54.60, 78.75] mumol/L, Z = 6.478, P < 0.001) were significantly higher in the death group that those in the recovered group. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also significantly higher in the death group on admission (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] mg/L vs.3.22 [1.04, 21.80] mg/L, Z = 10.206, P < 0.001) showed no significant improvement after treatment (109.25 [35.0, 170.28] mg/L vs. 81.60 [27.23, 179.08] mg/L, Z = 1.219, P = 0.233). The patients in the death group had more complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (89.9% vs. 7.6%, chi = 148.105, P < 0.001), acute cardiac injury (59.6% vs. 0.8%, chi = 93.222, P < 0.001), acute kidney injury (18.3% vs. 0, chi = 23.257, P < 0.001), shock (11.9% vs. 0, chi = 14.618, P < 0.001), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (6.4% vs. 0, chi = 7.655, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the recovered group, more patients in the death group exhibited characteristics of advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities, dyspnea, oxygen saturation decrease, increased WBC count, decreased lymphocytes, and elevated CRP levels. More patients in the death groups had complications such as ARDS, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, shock, and DIC."],"journal":"Chin Med J (Engl)","authors":["Deng, Yan","Liu, Wei","Liu, Kui","Fang, Yuan-Yuan","Shang, Jin","Zhou, Ling","Wang, Ke","Leng, Fan","Wei, Shuang","Chen, Lei","Liu, Hui-Guo"],"date":"2020-03-27T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32209890","source":"PubMed","week":"202013|Mar 23 - Mar 29","doi":"10.1097/CM9.0000000000000824","locations":["Wuhan","Wuhan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"e_drugs":["Creatinine"],"topics":["Mechanism"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138490541178880,"score":270.79},{"pmid":32297828,"title":"Correlation Between Relative Nasopharyngeal Virus RNA Load and Lymphocyte Count Disease Severity in Patients with COVID-19.","text":["Correlation Between Relative Nasopharyngeal Virus RNA Load and Lymphocyte Count Disease Severity in Patients with COVID-19.","The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between dynamic changes in the nasopharyngeal viral load of patients infected with the new coronavirus causing pneumonia and lymphocyte count disease severity. Cases newly diagnosed with COVID-19 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from January 2020 to February 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from throat swab sample DeltaCT values; lymphocyte and lymphocyte subset counts, coagulation system factor levels, myocardial injury indexes, and laboratory biochemical indicators were compared between the mild group and the severe group. The correlation between the relative load of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA and severe disease symptoms was analyzed. Of the 76 patients, 49 were male and 27 were female. The lymphocyte, CD4(+) T lymphocyte, and CD8(+) T lymphocyte counts all differed significantly between the two groups (p < 0.001), as did differences in interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, and IL-8 levels (p = 0.022, 0.026, and 0.012, respectively). Moreover, there were significant differences in prothrombin time, D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels between the mild group and the severe group (p = 0.029, 0.006, and <0.001, respectively), and in lactate dehydrogenase and troponin (p < 0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 RNA load and lymphocyte count, CD4(+) T lymphocyte count, and CD8(+) T lymphocyte count were linearly negatively correlated (p < 0.001). SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was positively correlated with IL-2R, prothrombin time, lactate dehydrogenase, and hypersensitive troponin T (p = 0.002, p = 0.009, and p < 0.001, respectively). In addition, the time that it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was significantly shorter for patients in the mild group than for those in the severe group (Z = -6.713, p < 0.001). In conclusion, relative SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in the nasopharynx is closely related to COVID-19 severity. If the relative RNA load was higher, the lymphocyte count was lower, organ damage was greater, and the time it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was longer.","Viral Immunol","Liu, Yang","Liao, Wenjian","Wan, Lagen","Xiang, Tianxing","Zhang, Wei","32297828"],"abstract":["The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between dynamic changes in the nasopharyngeal viral load of patients infected with the new coronavirus causing pneumonia and lymphocyte count disease severity.
