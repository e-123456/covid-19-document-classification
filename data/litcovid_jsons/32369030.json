Therefore, the objective of this report was to answer the question \"What rehabilitation do survivors of COVID-19 require?\". The question was stated within the context of a sub-acute hospital delivering geriatric inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services. Three areas relevant to rehabilitation after COVID-19 were identified. First, details of how patients might present have been summarized: comorbidities, complications from an intensive care unit stay +/- intubation, and the effects of the virus on multiple body systems, including cardiac, neurological, cognition, and mental health. Second, suggested procedures regarding design of an inpatient rehabilitation unit for COVID-19 survivors, staffing issues, and considerations for outpatient rehabilitation have been made. Third, guidelines for rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology) following COVID-19 have been made, with respect to recovery of the respiratory system as well as mobility and function. A thorough assessment and individualized, progressive treatment plan which focuses on function, disability, and return to participation in society will help each patient to maximize their function and quality of life. Careful consideration of the rehabilitation environment will ensure that all patients have the most complete recovery possible.","JMIR Public Health Surveill","Sheehy, Lisa Mary","32369030"],"abstract":["UNSTRUCTURED: Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), the infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, was first reported on December 31, 2019.

Patients not receiving care due to closure of outpatient services suffer a collateral damage. Our aim was to provide first data on impact of Covid-19 on people experiencing disability in Europe. METHODS: We developed an estimation from a survey and publicly available data. Thirty-eight countries have been inquired through the European Bodies of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine - the rehabilitation medical specialty. The 9-questions focused on March 31st, 2020. We used the following indicators: for inpatients, acute and rehabilitative hospital beds; for outpatients, missing uniform European data, we used information from Italy, Belgium and UK, and estimated for Europe basing on population, number of rehabilitation physicians, physiotherapists, and people with self-reported limitations. FINDINGS: Thirty-five countries (92%) including 99% of the population (809.9 million) answered. Stop of admissions to rehabilitation, early discharge and reduction of activities involved 194,800 inpatients in 10 countries.
