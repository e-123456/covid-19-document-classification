Patients with cardiac injury had higher mortality than those without cardiac injury (42 of 82 [51.2%] vs 15 of 334 [4.5%]; P < .001). In a Cox regression model, patients with vs those without cardiac injury were at a higher risk of death, both during the time from symptom onset (hazard ratio, 4.26 [95% CI, 1.92-9.49]) and from admission to end point (hazard ratio, 3.41 [95% CI, 1.62-7.16]). Conclusions and Relevance: Cardiac injury is a common condition among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and it is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality."],"journal":"JAMA Cardiol","authors":["Shi, Shaobo","Qin, Mu","Shen, Bo","Cai, Yuli","Liu, Tao","Yang, Fan","Gong, Wei","Liu, Xu","Liang, Jinjun","Zhao, Qinyan","Huang, He","Yang, Bo","Huang, Congxin"],"date":"2020-03-27T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32211816","week":"202013|Mar 23 - Mar 29","doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950","source":"PubMed","locations":["China","Wuhan"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1663095625824075776,"score":344.81717}]}
