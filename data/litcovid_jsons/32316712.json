The aims were to investigate medical needs of lung cancer patients and their mental health status during the epidemic periods, so as to provide rational recommendations for subsequent diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: The questionnaire was sent in the form of an electronic questionnaire at 7am on 4th, March, 2020, until 7am 6th, March, 2020, 368 questionnaires were recollected from 25 provinces (autonomous regions/municipalities) in 48 h. RESULTS: Of the 368 patients, 18 patients were excluded as they didn't receive anti-tumor treatment, and 350 patients were included in the final analysis. 229 cases were treated with oral targeted drugs, and 121 cases were treated with chemotherapy or immunotherapy. 41.3% of patients treated with intravenous chemotherapy or immunotherapy experienced treatment discontinuation, and the proportion of treatment discontinuation in chemotherapy or immunotherapy was higher than those treated with oral targeted drugs (21.0%). Whether oral targeted drugs or intravenous chemotherapy or immunotherapy, more than 60% of patients experienced delays in imaging examinations. Nearly one third of patients developed new symptoms or exacerbation of existing symptoms. 26.6%-28.9% of patients have changed their treatment plans through online consultation. During novel coronavirus pneumonia, 40%-75% of lung cancer patients have mental health problems, and more than 95% of patients support government's prevention and control measures. CONCLUSIONS: During the emergence of NCP, the medical needs of patients with lung cancer have not been enough, especially those who discontinued chemotherapy or immunotherapy. When medical institution resumes work, priority should be given to them. At the same time, mental health problems of patients should be valued and resolved timely.","Zhongguo Fei Ai Za Zhi","Xu, Haiyan","Yang, Ke","Yang, Guangjian","Yang, Lu","Mi, Yuling","Cui, Xiaohong","Yang, Min","Wang, Dan","Wang, Yan","32316712"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: With the rapid spread of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) worldwide and the escalation of prevention and control efforts, the routine medical needs of patients have been restricted.

Comorbidities, in particular, diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke, are strongly associated with the need for intensive treatment and a dismal outcome. A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution. Thus, there is concern that children treated for cancer may allso be at risk for an unfavourable course of infection. Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China, mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukaemia. AIM AND METHODS: We made a flash survey on COVID-19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short Web-based survey. RESULTS: We received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed up. At the time of the survey, more than 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease, and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken and treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Thus, even children receiving anticancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19. While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than that observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment.","Eur J Cancer","Hrusak, Ondrej","Kalina, Tomas","Wolf, Joshua","Balduzzi, Adriana","Provenzi, Massimo","Rizzari, Carmelo","Rives, Susana","Del Pozo Carlavilla, Maria","Alonso, Maria E V","Dominguez-Pinilla, Nerea","Bourquin, Jean-Pierre","Schmiegelow, Kjeld","Attarbaschi, Andishe","Grillner, Pernilla","Mellgren, Karin","van der Werff Ten Bosch, Jutte","Pieters, Rob","Brozou, Triantafyllia","Borkhardt, Arndt","Escherich, Gabriele","Lauten, Melchior","Stanulla, Martin","Smith, Owen","Yeoh, Allen E J","Elitzur, Sarah","Vora, Ajay","Li, Chi-Kong","Ariffin, Hany","Kolenova, Alexandra","Dallapozza, Luciano","Farah, Roula","Lazic, Jelena","Manabe, Atsushi","Styczynski, Jan","Kovacs, Gabor","Ottoffy, Gabor","Felice, Maria S","Buldini, Barbara","Conter, Valentino","Stary, Jan","Schrappe, Martin","32305831"],"abstract":["INTRODUCTION: Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, it is known that the severe course of the disease occurs mostly among the elderly, whereas it is rare among children and young adults.
