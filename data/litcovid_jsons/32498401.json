METHODS: This cross-sectional case control study examined a consecutive sample of patients older than 15 years treated at the epilepsy center of West China Hospital between 01 and 29 February 2020. As controls, sex- and age-matched healthy visitors of inpatients (unrelated to the patients) were also enrolled during the same period. Data on demographics and attention paid to COVID-19 were collected by online questionnaire, data on epilepsy features were collected from electronic medical records, and psychological distress was evaluated using the Kessler 6-item (K-6) psychological distress scale. Potential risk factors of severe psychological distress were identified using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: The 252 patients and 252 controls in this study were similar along all demographic variables except family income. Patients with epilepsy showed significantly higher K-6 scores than healthy controls and spent significantly more time following the COVID-19 outbreak (both p < 0.001). Univariate analyses associated both diagnosis of drug-resistant epilepsy and time spent paying attention to COVID-19 with severe psychological distress (defined as K-6 score > 12) (both p </= 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression identified two independent predictors of severe psychological distress: time spent paying attention to COVID-19 (OR 1.172, 95%CI 1.073, 1.280) and diagnosis of drug-resistant epilepsy (OR 0.283, 95%CI 0.128, 0.623). SIGNIFICANCE: During public health outbreaks, clinicians and caregivers should focus not only on seizure control but also on mental health of epilepsy patients, especially those with drug-resistant epilepsy. K-6 scores more than 12 should be indicated as severe psychological distress. This may mean, for example, encouraging patients to engage in other activities instead of excessively following media coverage of the outbreak.","Epilepsia","Hao, Xiaoting","Zhou, Dong","Li, Zhe","Zeng, Guojun","Hao, Nanya","Li, Enzhi","Li, Wenjing","Deng, Aiping","Lin, Mintao","Yan, Bo","32353184"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To compare the severity of psychological distress between epilepsy patients and healthy controls during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwest China, as well as identify potential risk factors of severe psychological distress among epilepsy patients.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence rate of insomnia and to confirm the related social psychological factors among medical staff in hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak. Method: Medical staff members in China were recruited, including frontline medical workers. The questionnaire, administered through the WeChat program, obtained demographic data and asked self-design questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, insomnia/depressive/anxiety symptoms, and stress-related symptoms. We used a logistic regression analysis to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors and insomnia symptoms. Result: There were a total of 1,563 participants in our study. Five-hundred-and-sixty-four (36.1%) participants had insomnia symptoms according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (total score >/= 8).
