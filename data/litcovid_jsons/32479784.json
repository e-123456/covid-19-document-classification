MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective single center study, which was conducted between 18 April 2020 and 30 April 2020, 20 SARS-CoV2 positive patients were compared with 20 non-CoVid-19 patients in the ICU with respect to the occurrence of DVT.

Results: Of the 143 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (aged 63 +/- 14 years; 74 [51.7%] man), 66 patients developed lower extremity DVT (46.1%, included 23 [34.8%] with proximal DVT and 43 [65.2%] with distal DVT).Compared with patients who with no DVT, patients with DVT were older and had a lower oxygenation index, a higher rate of cardiac injury, and worse prognosis including an increased proportion of deaths (23 [34.8%] vs 9 [11.7%], P = 0.001) and a decreased proportion of patients discharged (32 [48.5%] vs 60 [77.9%], P < 0.001).
