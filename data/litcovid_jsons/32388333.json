Internet of Things (IoT) enabled healthcare system is useful for proper monitoring of COVID-19 patients, by employing an interconnected network. This technology helps to increase patient satisfaction and reduces readmission rate in the hospital. METHODS: Searched the databases of Google Scholar, PubMed, SCOPUS and ResearchGate using the keywords \"Internet of things\" or \"IoT\" and \"COVID-19\". Further inputs are also taken from blogs and relevant reports. RESULTS: IoT implementation impacts on reducing healthcare cost and improve treatment outcome of the infected patient. Therefore, this present study based research is attempted to explore, discuss, and highlight the overall applications of the well-proven IoT philosophy by offering a perspective roadmap to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, twelve significant applications of IoT are identified and discussed. It has ultimately forced the researchers, academicians, and scientists to propose some productive solutions to overcome or confront this pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: IoT is helpful for an infected patient of COVID-19 to identify symptoms and provides better treatment rapidly. It is useful for patient, physician, surgeon and hospital management system.","Diabetes Metab Syndr","Singh, Ravi Pratap","Javaid, Mohd","Haleem, Abid","Suman, Rajiv","32388333"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND AND AIM: The current global challenge of COVID-19 pandemic has surpassed the provincial, radical, conceptual, spiritual, social, and pedagogical boundaries.
