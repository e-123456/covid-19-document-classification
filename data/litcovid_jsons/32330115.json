In addition, individuals were encouraged to adopt personal health measures, such as social isolation. Information regarding the disease and measures were distributed through a variety of channels including social media, news websites and emails. Previous research suggests that the vast amount of available information can be confusing, potentially resulting in over-concern and information overload. OBJECTIVE: We investigate the impact of online information on individual-level intention to voluntarily self-isolate during the pandemic. Using the protection-motivation theory as a framework, we propose a model outlining the effect of cyberchondria and information overload on individuals' perceptions and motivation. METHODS: To test the proposed model, we collected data with an online survey (N=225) and analysed it using partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The effects of social media and living situation were tested through multi-group analysis (PLS-MGA). RESULTS: Cyberchondria and information overload had a significant impact on individuals' threat and coping perceptions, and through them on self-isolation intention. Among the appraisal constructs, perceived severity (P=0.002) and self-efficacy (P=0.003) positively impacted self-isolation intention while response cost (P<0.001) affected the intention negatively. Cyberchondria (P=0.003) and information overload (P=0.003) indirectly affected self-isolation intention through the aforementioned perceptions. Using social media as an information source increased both cyberchondria and information overload. No difference in perceptions was found between people living alone and those living with their families. (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19, frequent use of social media contributed to information overload and over concern among individuals.

Not much is known about the topics being shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms (\"corona,\" \"2019-nCov,\" and \"COVID-19\"), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic. RESULTS: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings). CONCLUSIONS: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media. There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the spread of fake news.","J Med Internet Res","Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa","Alhuwail, Dari","Househ, Mowafa","Hamdi, Mounir","Shah, Zubair","32287039"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is taking a toll on the world's health care infrastructure as well as the social, economic, and psychological well-being of humanity.

The role of social media amid the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has often been criticized, but little systematic research has been conducted on this issue. Social media functions as a convenient source of information in pandemic situations. OBJECTIVE: Few infodemiology studies have applied network analysis in conjunction with content analysis. This study investigates information transmission networks and news sharing behaviors regarding SARS-CoV-2 on Twitter in Korea. The real-time aggregation of social media data can serve as a starting point for designing strategic messages for health campaigns and establishing an effective communication system during this outbreak. METHODS: Korean SARS-CoV-2-related Twitter data were collected on February 29, 2020. Our final sample comprises 43,832 users and 78,233 relationships on Twitter. We generate four networks in terms of key issues regarding SARS-CoV-2 in Korea. This study comparatively investigates how SARS-CoV-2 -related issues have circulated on Twitter through network analysis. Next, we classify top news channels shared via tweets. Lastly, we conduct a content analysis of news frames used in the top shared sources. RESULTS: The network analysis suggests that the spread of information was faster in the Coronavirus network than in the other networks (Corona19, Shincheon, and Daegu). People who used the word \"Coronavirus\" communicated more frequently with each other. The spread of information was faster, and the diameter value was lower than for those who used other terms. Many of the news items highlighted the positive roles being played by individuals and groups, directing readers' attention to the crisis. Ethical issues such as deviant behavior among the population and an entertainment frame highlighting celebrity donations also often emerged. There was a significant difference in the use of non-portal (n = 14) and portal news (n = 26) sites between the four network types (N = 40).
