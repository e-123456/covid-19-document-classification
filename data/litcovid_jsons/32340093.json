Methods: A joint investigation team of emergency response for COVID-19 epidemic by CDC professional workers of Liaocheng city and district at two levels on January 30, 2020. According to a indicator case from ZH supermarkets, close contacts and related subjects were tracked and screened on February 1, including ZH supermarket employees, family members having contact history with related cases during January 13-26, supermarket clients during January 16-30 and family members of related cases. an epidemiological investigation was carried on and their swab of nose /throat were collected and were sent to Liaocheng CDC laboratory, real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2.

The causative agent, 2019 novel CoV (2019-nCoV), has spread rapidly to more than 25 countries worldwide. Human-to-human transmission has accounted for most of the infections outside Wuhan. Most studies to date on COVID-19 have focused on disease etiology and the genomics of 2019-nCoV, with few reports on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of infected patients. Methods: We report early clinical features of 26 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Liaocheng Infectious Disease Hospital in Shandong Province. Results: The median age of the 26 patients with COVID-19 in this study was 42 years. The most common occupation was retail staff (16 patients, 61.54%), with 11 patients or their family members working at the same supermarket. Only 2 patients had visited Wuhan since December 2019; the other cases of 2019-nCoV infection arose from patient-to-patient transmission. Twelve patients had more than one sign or symptom; however, seven patients had no sign or symptom. The average time from symptom onset to admission was 4.5 days. CT revealed signs of bronchitis in 2 patients and unilateral and bilateral pneumonia in 9 and 15 patients, respectively. The patients received the following treatments: antiviral therapy (100%), Chinese medicine (76.92%), antibiotics (50%), gastric mucosal protection (19.23%), immunotherapy (7.69%), and glucocorticoids (3.85%).
