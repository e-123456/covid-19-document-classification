The optimal cutoff values for FAR and PLT count were 0.0883 and 135*10(9)/L, respectively. The C-index [0.712 (95% CI = 0.610-0.814)], decision curve, clinical impact curve showed that Nomogram could be used to predict the disease progression. In addition, the Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that potential risk decreased in patients with FAR<0.0883 and PLT count>135*10(9)/L.The model showed a good negative predictive value [(0.9474 (95%CI = 0.845-0.986)].This study revealed that FAR and PLT count were independent risk factors for severe illness and the severity of COVID-19 might be excluded when FAR<0.0883 and PLT count>135*10(9)/L."],"journal":"Platelets","authors":["Bi, Xiaojie","Su, Zhengxian","Yan, Haixi","Du, Juping","Wang, Jing","Chen, Linping","Peng, Minfei","Chen, Shiyong","Shen, Bo","Li, Jun"],"date":"2020-05-06T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32367765","source":"PubMed","week":"202019|May 04 - May 10","doi":"10.1080/09537104.2020.1760230","keywords":["covid-19","coagulation and fibrinolysis","fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (far)","non-severe survival (nss)","platelet count (plt)","prediction"],"topics":["Diagnosis","Treatment"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138496291569665,"score":328.65314}]}
