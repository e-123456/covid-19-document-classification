MATERIALS AND METHODS: A COVID-19-specific remote patient monitoring solution (GetWell Loop) was offered to patients with COVID-19 symptoms. The program engaged patients and provided educational materials and the opportunity to share concerns. Alerts were resolved through a virtual care workforce of providers and medical students. RESULTS: Between March 18 and April 20, 2020, 2,255 of 3,701 (60.93%) patients with COVID-19 symptoms enrolled resulting in over 2,303 alerts, 4,613 messages, 13 hospital admissions, and 91 emergency room visits. A satisfaction survey was given to 300 patient respondents, 74% of whom would be extremely likely to recommend their doctor. DISCUSSION: This program provided a safe and satisfying experience for patients while minimizing COVID-19 exposure and in-person healthcare utilization. CONCLUSION: Remote patient monitoring appears to be an effective approach for managing COVID-19 symptoms at home.","J Am Med Inform Assoc","Annis, Tucker","Pleasants, Susan","Hultman, Gretchen","Lindemann, Elizabeth","Thompson, Joshua A","Billecke, Stephanie","Badlani, Sameer","Melton, Genevieve B","32392280"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To evaluate early lessons from a remote patient monitoring engagement and education technology solution for patients with COVID-19 symptoms.
