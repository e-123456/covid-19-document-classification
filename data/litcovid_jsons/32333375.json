We had a dedicated task force that identified a response plan, which included: (1) establishment of dedicated, cohorted intensive care unit(s) (ICU) for COVID-19-positive patients; (2) design of appropriate procedures for pre-triage, diagnosis and isolation of suspected and confirmed cases; and (3) training of all staff to work in the dedicated ICU in personal protective equipment use and patient management. Hospital multidisciplinary and departmental collaboration was needed to work on all principles of surge capacity, including: space definition; supplies provision; staff recruitment; and ad-hoc training. Dedicated protocols were applied where full isolation of spaces, staff and patients was implemented. Opening the unit and the whole hospital emergency process required a multidisciplinary, multilevel involvement of healthcare providers and hospital managers all working towards a common goal: patient care and hospital safety.
