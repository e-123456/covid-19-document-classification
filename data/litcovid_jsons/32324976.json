METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search was carried out to find studies published from December 2019 to 22nd March 2020 from 5 Database. The language of literature included English and Chinese. The point prevalence of severe Covid-19 in patients with pre-existing COPD and those with ongoing smoking was evaluated with this meta-analysis. RESULTS: Overall 11 case-series, published either in Chinese or English language with a total of 2002 cases were included in the study. The pooled OR of COPD and the development of severe Covid-19 was 4.38 (Fixed effect model, 95% CI: 2.34-8.20), while the OR of ongoing smoking was 1.98 (Fixed effect model, 95% CI: 1.29-3.05). There was no publication bias as examined by the funnel plot and Egger's test (p=NS). The heterogeneity of included studies was moderate for both COPD and ongoing smoking history on the severity of Covid-19.

Since the novel coronavirus has spread worldwide seriously, there is growing concern that patients who have chronic respiratory conditions like COPD can easily be infected and are more prone to having severe illness and even mortality because of lung dysfunction. Loquat leaves have long been used as an important material for both pharmaceutical and functional applications in the treatment of lung disease in Asia, especially in China and Japan. Total flavonoids (TF), the main active components derived from loquat leaves, showed remarkable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, their protective activity against CS-induced COPD airway inflammation and oxidative stress and its underlying mechanism still remain not well-understood. The present study uses a CS-induced mouse model to estimate the morphological changes in lung tissue. The results demonstrated that TF suppressed the histological changes in the lungs of CS-challenged mice, as evidenced by reduced generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), nitric oxide (NO), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and diminished the protein expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). Moreover, TF also inhibited phosphorylation of IKK, IkappaB and NFkappaB and increased p-Akt. Interestingly, TF could inhibit CS-induced oxidative stress in the lungs of COPD mice. TF treatment significantly inhibited the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). In addition, TF markedly downregulated TRPV1 and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and upregulated the expression of SOD-2, while the p-JNK level was observed to be inhibited in COPD mice. Taken together, our findings showed that the protective effect and putative mechanism of the action of TF resulted in the inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress through the regulation of TRPV1 and the related signal pathway in lung tissues. It suggested that TF derived from loquat leaves could be considered to be an alternative or a new functional material and used for the treatment of CS-induced COPD.","Food Funct","Jian, Tunyu","Chen, Jian","Ding, Xiaoqin","Lv, Han","Li, Jiawei","Wu, Yuexian","Ren, Bingru","Tong, Bei","Zuo, Yuanyuan","Su, Kelei","Li, Weilin","32253400"],"abstract":["Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic, progressive lung disease with few successful treatments, and is strongly associated with cigarette smoking (CS).
