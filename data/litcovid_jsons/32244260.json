Methods: Epidemiological investigation was conducted to collect the information of confirmed COVID-19 cases, including demographic, epidemiological and clinical information. Results: As of 25 February 2020, a total of 91 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in Gansu. The epidemic of COVID-19 in Gansu can be divided as three different stages, i.e. imported case stage, imported-case plus indigenous case stage, and indigenous case stage. A total of 63 cases were clustered cases (69.23%), 3 cases were medical staff infected with non-occupational exposure. The initial symptoms included fever (54.95%, 50/91), cough (52.75%, 48/91), or fatigue (28.57%, 26/91), the proportion of each symptom showed a decreasing trend along with the three epidemic stages, but only the differences in proportions of fever (trend chi(2)=2.20, P<0.05) and fatigue (trend chi(2)=3.18, P<0.05) among the three epidemic stages were statistically significant.

The patients were diagnosed between January 25th, 2020 and February 21st, 2020 in 21 hospitals in 17 cities of six provinces(autonomous region) of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Hebei, Henan and Shandong. Results: The age of the 31 children with 2019-nCoV infection was 7 years and 1 month (6 months -17 years). Nine cases (29%) were imported cases. Other 21 cases (68%) had contact with confirmed infected adults. One case (3%) had contact with asymptomatic returnees from Wuhan. Among the 31 children, 28 patients (90%) were family cluster cases. The clinical types were asymptomatic type in 4 cases (13%), mild type in 13 cases (42%), and common type in 14 cases (45%). No severe or critical type existed. The most common symptom was fever (n=20, 65%), including 1 case of high fever, 9 cases of moderate fever, 10 cases of low fever. Fever lasted from 1 day to 9 days. The fever of fifteen cases lasted for </=3 d, while in other 5 cases lasted > 3 d. Other symptoms included cough (n=14, 45%), fatigue (n=3, 10%) and diarrhea (n=3, 9%). Pharyngalgia, runny nose, dizziness, headache and vomiting were rare. In the early stage, the total leukocytes count in peripheral blood decreased in 2 cases (6%), the lymphocytes count decreased in 2 cases (6%), and the platelet count increased in 2 cases (6%).Elevation of C-reactive protein (10%, 3/30), erythrocyte sedimentation rate(19%,4/21), procalcitonin(4%,1/28), liver enzyme(22%, 6/27) and muscle enzyme (15%, 4/27) occurred in different proportions.
