Anticipating a need for such therapies during the pandemic, our center created a targeted protocol for ECMO therapy in COVID-19 patients that allows us to provide this life-saving therapy to our sickest patients without overburdening already stretched resources or excessively exposing healthcare staff to infection risk. METHODS: As a major regional referral program, we used the framework of our well-established ECMO service-line to outline specific team structures, modified patient eligibility criteria, cannulation strategies, and management protocols for the COVID-19 ECMO program. RESULTS: During the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak in Massachusetts, 6 patients were placed on VV ECMO for refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure. The median (interquartile range) age was 47 years (43-53) with most patients being male (83%) and obese (67%). All cannulations were performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit in patients who had undergone a trial of rescue therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome including lung protective ventilation, paralysis, prone positioning, and inhaled nitric oxide. At the time of this report, 83% (5/6) of the patients are still alive with 1 death on ECMO, attributed to hemorrhagic stroke. 67% of patients (4/6) have been successfully decannulated, including 2 that have been successfully extubated and one who was discharged from the hospital. The median duration of VV ECMO therapy for patients who have been decannulated is 12 days (4-18 days). CONCLUSIONS: This is 1 the first case series describing VV ECMO outcomes in COVID-19 patients.
