Here we characterise the outcomes of a cohort of patients with cancer and COVID-19 and identify potential prognostic factors for mortality and severe illness. METHODS: In this cohort study, we collected de-identified data on patients with active or previous malignancy, aged 18 years and older, with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection from the USA, Canada, and Spain from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) database for whom baseline data were added between March 17 and April 16, 2020. We collected data on baseline clinical conditions, medications, cancer diagnosis and treatment, and COVID-19 disease course. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality within 30 days of diagnosis of COVID-19. We assessed the association between the outcome and potential prognostic variables using logistic regression analyses, partially adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and obesity. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04354701, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Of 1035 records entered into the CCC19 database during the study period, 928 patients met inclusion criteria for our analysis. Median age was 66 years (IQR 57-76), 279 (30%) were aged 75 years or older, and 468 (50%) patients were male. The most prevalent malignancies were breast (191 [21%]) and prostate (152 [16%]). 366 (39%) patients were on active anticancer treatment, and 396 (43%) had active (measurable) cancer. At analysis (May 7, 2020), 121 (13%) patients had died. In logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with increased 30-day mortality, after partial adjustment, were: increased age (per 10 years; partially adjusted odds ratio 1.84, 95% CI 1.53-2.21), male sex (1.63, 1.07-2.48), smoking status (former smoker vs never smoked: 1.60, 1.03-2.47), number of comorbidities (two vs none: 4.50, 1.33-15.28), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or higher (status of 2 vs 0 or 1: 3.89, 2.11-7.18), active cancer (progressing vs remission: 5.20, 2.77-9.77), and receipt of azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine (vs treatment with neither: 2.93, 1.79-4.79; confounding by indication cannot be excluded). Compared with residence in the US-Northeast, residence in Canada (0.24, 0.07-0.84) or the US-Midwest (0.50, 0.28-0.90) were associated with decreased 30-day all-cause mortality. Race and ethnicity, obesity status, cancer type, type of anticancer therapy, and recent surgery were not associated with mortality. INTERPRETATION: Among patients with cancer and COVID-19, 30-day all-cause mortality was high and associated with general risk factors and risk factors unique to patients with cancer.

Enrolled patients were statistically matched (2:1) with patients admitted with COVID-19 who did not have cancer with propensity score on the basis of age, sex, and comorbidities. Demographic characteristics, laboratory examinations, illness severity, and clinical interventions were compared between patients with COVID-19 with or without cancer as well as between patients with cancer with non-severe or severe COVID-19.

RESULTS: A total of 52 cancer patients with COVID-19 were included. Median age of 52 cancer patients with COVID-19 was 63 years (34-98). 33(63.5%) patients were mild and 19(36.5%) were severe/critical. Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (10, 19.2%). The common symptoms were as follows: fever (25%), dry cough (17.3%), chest distress (11.5%) and fatigue (9.6%).There were 33(63.5%) patients had comorbidities, the most common symptom was hypertension (17, 51.5%). 26(78.8%) patients developed pneumonia on admission.

METHOD: Medical records, laboratory results and radiologic findings of 52 cancer patients with COVID-19 were collected, clinical characteristics and outcomes were summarized. RESULTS: A total of 52 cancer patients with COVID-19 were included. Median age of 52 cancer patients with COVID-19 was 63 years (34-98). 33(63.5%) patients were mild and 19(36.5%) were severe/critical. Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (10, 19.2%). The common symptoms were as follows: fever (25%), dry cough (17.3%), chest distress (11.5%) and fatigue (9.6%).There were 33(63.5%) patients had comorbidities, the most common symptom was hypertension (17, 51.5%). 26(78.8%) patients developed pneumonia on admission. Lymphocytes (0.6x10(9) /L) decreased in both mild and severe/critical patients. Median levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein(CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and lactate dehydrogenase(LDH) were 2.8 mg/L, 70.5 mg/L, 0.3 ng/mL, and 318 U/L respectively, which increased significantly in severe/critical patients compared to the mild patients. Interleukin 6(IL-6) (12.6 pg/ml) increased in both mild and severe/critical patients, there was a significant difference between them. Complications were observed in 29(55.8%) patients, such as liver injury (19, 36.5%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (9, 17.3%), sepsis (8, 15.4%), myocardial injury (8, 15.4%), renal insufficiency (4, 7.7%), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (3, 5.8%).11(21.2%) cancer patients died. CONCLUSION: The infection rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-COV-2) in cancer patients was higher than the general population, cancer patients with COVID-19 showed deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes.
