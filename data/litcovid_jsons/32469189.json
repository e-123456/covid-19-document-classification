In order to overcome these challenges, the Polish the National Health Fund has facilitated telemedical consultations. AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare teleconsultations to regular ambulatory clinic of implantable devices (ACIM) visits and to assess whether teleconsultations would be an adequate replacement during a time when face-to-face contact should be limited. METHODS: Teleconsultations in the ACIM were introduced for patients without the possibility of remote control cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED). Prior to planned visits physicians made phone calls and interviewed the patient about their health. Further treatment decisions were made based on the interview and available documentation. RESULTS: Teleconsultations were performed during a 3.5-week period (13.03.2020 to 01.04.2020). Of the 400 patients planned for visits in the ACIM, 349 were consulted by phone. 299 patients confirmed stable health. 14/349 patients reported some symptoms and 4/349 patients were hospitalized; 2/349 patients changed their primary ACIM and were no longer under our care, 1/349 patient was undergoing quarantine, 15/349 patients required additional intervention and 15 patients had died prior to contact. In general patients gave positive feedback on their teleconsultations. CONCLUSIONS: Teleconsultations are a much-needed solution during the COVID-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility of planned real-time audiovisual teleconsultation over the internet in patients with MS. METHODS: Twenty subjects with MS presenting at a specialized MS center in Belgium were recruited for this study. One teleconsultation was scheduled in each participant. Patients were provided a unique hyperlink by mail in advance, leading them automatically and directly to the virtual waiting room, where they could accept or decline our incoming call. All teleconsultations were performed by a trained medical student with the intention to keep the conversation similar to what is usually discussed during a classic face-to-face MS consultation; no remote physical exams were performed.

Movement disorder (Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia), neuropsychiatric disorder (obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, depression), and epilepsy patients can develop varying degrees of symptom worsening from interruption of therapy due to neurostimulator battery reaching end of life, device malfunction or infection. Urgent intervention to maintain or restore stimulation may be required for patients with Parkinson's disease who can develop a rare but potentially life-threatening complication known as DBS-withdrawal syndrome. Similarly, patients with generalized dystonia can develop status dystonicus, patients with obsessive compulsive disorder can become suicidal, and epilepsy patients can experience potentially life-threatening worsening of seizures as a result of therapy cessation. DBS system infection can require urgent, and rarely emergent surgery. Elective interventions including new implantations and initial programming should be postponed. For patients with existing DBS systems, the battery status and electrical integrity interrogation can now be performed using patient programmers, and employed through telemedicine visits or by phone consultations. The decision for replacement of the implantable pulse generator to prevent interruption of DBS therapy should be made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration battery status and a patient's tolerance to potential therapy disruption.
