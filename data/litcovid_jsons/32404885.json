We sought to determine the clinical characteristics relevant to the clinical course of COVID-19 by comparing the family cluster to unrelated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection so that the presence of potential determinants of disease severity, other than traditional risk factors previously reported, could be investigated. METHODS: 29 patient files were investigated in Group 1 and Group 2 was created with 52 consecutive COVID-19 patients with age and gender compatibility. The virus was detected for diagnosis. The clinical, laboratory and imaging features of all patients were retrospectively screened. Disease course was assessed using records regarding outcome from patient files retrospectively. Groups were compared with respect to baseline characteristics, disease severity on presentation, disease course. RESULTS: There was no difference between the two groups in terms of comorbidity and smoking history. In terms of in-hospital treatment, use differed not significantly between two groups. We found that all 29 patients in Group 1 had severe pneumonia, 18 patients had severe pneumonia. Hospitalization rates, length of hospital stay and transferred to ICU were found to be statistically significantly higher in Group 1.
