MATERIALS AND METHODS: Baseline CT scans and clinical and laboratory data of 72 patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia (39 men, 46.2 +/- 15.9 years) were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline CT findings including lobar distribution, presence of ground glass opacities, consolidation, linear opacities, and lung severity score were evaluated. The outcome event was recovery with hospital discharge. The time from symptom onset to discharge or the end of follow-up (for those remained hospitalized) was recorded. Data were censored in events such as death or discharge without recovery. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to explore the association between initial CT, clinical or laboratory findings, and discharge with recovery, whereby hazard ratio (HR) values < 1 indicated a lower rate of discharge at four weeks and longer time until discharge. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients recovered and were discharged during the study period with a median length of admission of 16 days (range, 9 to 25 days), while the rest remained hospitalized at the end of this study (median, 17.5 days; range, 4 to 27 days).

Thereafter, consolidations generally dissipated into GGO and the frequency of GGO increased in the 3rd week (76.5%) and 4th week (71.4%). Opacities were mainly located in the peripheral (76.5%), subpleural (47.1%) zones of the lungs, and presented as focal (35.3%) or multifocal (29.4%) in the 1st week and became more diffuse in the 2nd (47.1%) and 3rd week (58.8%), then showed reduced extent in 4th week (50%). CONCLUSIONS: The progression course of CT pattern was later than the clinical parameters within the first two weeks since admission; however, there was a synchronized improvement in both clinical and radiologic features in the 4th week."],"journal":"Clin Infect Dis","authors":["Han, Xiaoyu","Cao, Yukun","Jiang, Nanchuan","Chen, Yan","Alwalid, Osamah","Zhang, Xin","Gu, Jin","Dai, Meng","Liu, Jie","Zhu, Wanyue","Zheng, Chuansheng","Shi, Heshui"],"date":"2020-04-01T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32227091","source":"PubMed","week":"202014|Mar 30 - Apr 05","doi":"10.1093/cid/ciaa271","keywords":["covid-19","computed tomography","novel coronavirus pneumonia","viral pneumonia"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138492469510146,"score":299.59476}]}
