Nevertheless, some controversy still exists and there is limited information of the ACEIs/ARBs effect size on COVID-19 prognosis. AIM AND METHODS: We aimed to measure the effect of ACEIs and/or ARBs on COVID-19 severe clinical illness by a meta-analysis. Literature search included all studies published since the COVID-19 outbreak began (December 2019) until May 9, 2020. We analyzed information from studies that included tested COVID-19 patients with arterial hypertension as comorbidity prior to hospital admission and history of taking ACEIs, ARBs, or ACEIs/ARBs. RESULTS: We included 16 studies that involved 24,676 COVID-19 patients, and we compared patients with critical (n=4134) vs. non-critical (n=20,542) outcomes. The overall assessment by estimating random effects shows that the use of ACEIs/ARBs is not associated with higher risk of in-hospital-death and/or severe illness among hypertensive patients with COVID-19 infection. On the contrary, effect estimate shows an overall protective effect of RAAS inhibitors/blockers (ACEIs, ARBs, and/or ACEIs/ARBs) with approximately 23 % reduced risk f death and/or critical disease (OR: 0.768, 95%CI: 0.651-0.907, p=0.0018).
