RESULTS: Of the 48 suspected cases, 18 were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 30 were excluded. Each of the confirmed cases were discussed among MDT for 2 to 12 times with an average of (4.7+/-3.2) times; while for non-COVID-19 patients were discussed for 2 to 4 times with an average of (2.3+/-0.6) times per case.
