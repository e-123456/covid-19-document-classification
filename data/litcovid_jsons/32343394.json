Vulnerable populations to this outbreak and its physical and mental health impact include community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. Telehealth is becoming a potential major tool to deliver healthcare and support preventing the risk of exposure. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was threefold: 1) to explore the physical and mental health and well-being impact of confinement in community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, 2) to provide TV-based and telephone-based health and social support, and 3) to study the effect of a TV-based assistive integrated technology (TV-AssistDem). METHODS: A telephone-based survey was administered in Spain to 93 participants of the TV-AssistDem clinical trial from the 25th of March to 6th of April 2020. RESULTS: 60(65%) respondents were women, aged 73. 34 (SD=6.07) and 69(74%) lived accompanied. Lockdown measures forced 17(18%) to change their living arrangements. Health status was found optimal in 89 (96%) with no COVID-19 symptoms. Grocery and pharmacy outings were done by family members in 68(73%). 57(61%) respondents reported overall well-being and 65(70%) maintained sleep. However, those living alone presented greater negative feelings and sleeping problems. Regarding leisure activities, 53(57%) went on walks, 32(35%) did memory games, 55(60%) watched TV, and 91(98%) telephone called relatives. 58(64%) respondents reported accessing moderately or too much COVID-19 information, using 89(97%) Television sets, and 56 (62%) stated understanding this information in extreme. 39(39%) respondents had contacted health and social services whilst 29(31%) requested information regarding these services during the telephone call. Regarding differences between the intervention and control group there were no significant differences in health and well-being. Respondents with TV-AssistDem did more memory exercises (52% vs. 17.4%; P<.001) than controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that during the coronavirus disease confinement the physical and mental health and well-being of our vulnerable population at risk was overall optimal. However, those living alone reported greater psychological negative impact and sleeping problems. Measures adopted to face the negative experience of confinement included: keeping well informed of the situation and accessing health and social services, counting with a support network which prevented risk of exposure to COVID-19 and guaranteed food and medical supplies, a daily routine with maintained sleeping habits and leisure activities, staying physically and mentally active with cognitive stimulation exercises, and ensuring social connectedness using technologies. Television sets stood out as preferred technological devices to access COVID-19 information, watch TV as a recreational activity, and do memory exercises as an intellectual activity. TV-based telehealth support using TV-AssistDem has demonstrated its potential in terms of cognitive stimulation.
