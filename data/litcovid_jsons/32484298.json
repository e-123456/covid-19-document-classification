Neck circumference (NC) has been shown to be strongly related to cardiometabolic and respiratory illnesses even after adjustment for body mass index (BMI). We performed a prospective study to investigate the potential of NC to predict the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in adult COVID-19 inpatients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: we prospectively and consecutively enrolled COVID-19 adult patients admitted to dedicated medical wards of two Italian hospitals from March 25th to April seventh 2020. On admission, clinical, biochemical and anthropometric data, including BMI and NC were collected. As primary outcome measure, the maximum respiratory support received was evaluated.

In multivariable logistic regression analyses, after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension and COPD, NC resulted independently and significantly associated with IMV risk (adjusted OR 1.260 - per 1 cm increase 95% CI:1.120-1.417; P < 0.001), with a stronger association in the subgroup with BMI </=30 Kg/m(2) (adjusted OR 1.526; 95% CI:1.243-1.874; P < 0.001).

RESULTS: Of 11 544 people tested for SARS-Cov-2, 5566 (48.2%) were positive.
