Here, we used a digital PCR assay to determine the absolute SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy number in 63 nasopharyngeal samples and assess the effect of inactivation methods on viral RNA copy number. Viral inactivation was performed with three different methods: (1) incubation with TRIzol(R) LS Reagent for 10 min at room temperature, (2) heating in a waterbath at 56 degrees C for 30 min, and (3) high-temperature treatment, including 121 degrees C autoclaving for 20 min, 100 degrees C boiling for 20 min, and 80 degrees C heating for 20 min. Compared to the amount of RNA in the original sample, TRIzol treatment destroyed 47.54% of N gene and 39.85% of ORF 1ab. For samples treated at 56 degrees C for 30 min, the copy number of N gene and ORF 1ab was reduced by 48.55% and 56.40%, respectively.
