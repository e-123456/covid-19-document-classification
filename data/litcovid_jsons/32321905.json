In this study, aiming to investigate these adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database, we conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine. Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model: exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR > 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited. There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation.

Chloroquine is well absorbed and distributes extensively resulting in a large volume of distribution with an apparent and terminal half-life of 1.6 days and 2 weeks, respectively. Chloroquine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 and renal clearance is responsible for one third of total clearance. The lack of reliable information on target concentrations or doses for COVID-19 implies that for both adults and children, doses that proved effective and safe in malaria should be considered, such as 'loading doses' in adults (30 mg/kg over 48 h) and children (70 mg/kg over 5 days), which reported good tolerability. Here, plasma concentrations were < 2.5 mumol/L, which is associated with (minor) toxicity. While the influence of renal dysfunction, critical illness, or obesity seems small, in critically ill patients, reduced absorption may be anticipated. Clinical experience has shown that chloroquine has a narrow safety margin, as three times the adult therapeutic dosage for malaria can be lethal when given as a single dose. Although infrequent, poisoning in children is extremely dangerous where one to two tablets can potentially be fatal. In conclusion, the pharmacokinetic and safety properties of chloroquine suggest that chloroquine can be used safely for an acute virus infection, under corrected QT monitoring, but also that the safety margin is small, particularly in children.","Clin Pharmacokinet","Smit, Cornelis","Peeters, Mariska Y M","van den Anker, John N","Knibbe, Catherijne A J","32306288"],"abstract":["Since in vitro studies and a preliminary clinical report suggested the efficacy of chloroquine for COVID-19-associated pneumonia, there is increasing interest in this old antimalarial drug.
