Over 20 international researchers in the field of aging have contributed to this document. This commentary discusses how older people are misrepresented and undervalued in the current public discourse surrounding the pandemic. It points to issues in documenting the deaths of older adults, the lack of preparation for such a crisis in long term care homes, how some \"protective\" policies can be considered patronizing and how the initial perception of the public was that the virus was really an older adult problem. This commentary also calls attention to important intergenerational solidarity that has occurred during this crisis to ensure support and social-inclusion of older adults, even at a distance.

High morbidity and mortality rates of COVID-19 have been observed among older adults, and this has been widely reported in both mainstream and social media. The objective of this study was to analyze tweets related to COVID-19 and older adults, and to identify ageist content. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: We obtained a representative sample of original tweets posted between March 12 and March 21, 2020, containing the keywords \"elderly\", \"older\", and/or \"boomer\" plus the hashtags \"#COVID19\" and/or \"#coronavirus\". MEASUREMENTS: We identified the type of user and number of followers for each account. Tweets were classified by three raters as: 1) informative; 2) personal accounts; 3) personal opinions; 4) advice seeking; 5) jokes; and 6) miscellaneous. Potentially offensive content, as well as that downplaying the severity of COVID-19 because it mostly affects older adults, was identified. RESULTS: 18,128 tweets were obtained, of which a random sample of 351 was analyzed. Most accounts (91.7%) belonged to individuals. The most common types of tweets were personal opinions (31.9%), followed by informative tweets (29.6%), jokes/ridicule (14.3%), and personal accounts (13.4%). Seventy-seven tweets (21.9%) likely intended to ridicule or offend someone, while 21.1% had content which implied that the life of older adults was less valuable, or downplayed the relevance of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Most COVID-19 and older adults-related tweets contained personal opinions, personal accounts, and jokes. Almost a quarter of analyzed tweets had ageist or potentially offensive content towards older adults. This article is protected by copyright.
