Primary cultures usually have very low yields, and the high variability from any original tissue specimens, largely limiting their applications in research. Animal models are often used for studies of virus infections, disease modeling, development of antiviral drugs and vaccines. Human viruses often need a series of passages in vivo in order to adapt to the host environment because of variable receptors on the cell surface and may have intracellular restrictions from the cell types or host species.
