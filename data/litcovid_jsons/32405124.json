RESULTS: All patients had lesions clinically consistent with chilblains of the toes or feet, with 3 also having lesions of the fingers. Pruritus and mild pain were the only skin symptoms elicited, and only 10 had mild respiratory and/or GI symptoms. None had fever. Coagulation tests, hemogram, serum chemistry and lupus anticoagulant were normal in all patients tested. One out of 16 tested cases had elevated D-dimer results, but without systemic symptoms or other lab anomalies. SARS-CoV-2 PCR tested in 19 cases was positive in just 1 case. Skin biopsies obtained in 6 patients were consistent with chilblains. On follow-up, all cases showed spontaneous marked improvement or complete healing.
