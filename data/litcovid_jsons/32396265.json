Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that lymphocyte (LYM) count (odds ratio [OR] 0.009 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.001-0.138]; p = .001) and older age (OR 1.1 22 [95% CI 1.007-1.249]; p = .037) were independently associated with hospital mortality. White blood cell count was also an important risk factor (p = .052). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the logistic regression model was 0.913. Risk factors for in-hospital death were similar between older men and women. CONCLUSION: Older age and lower LYM count on admission were associated with death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Stringent monitoring and early intervention are needed to reduce mortality in these patients. This article is protected by copyright.
