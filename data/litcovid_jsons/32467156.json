Effective contact tracing for potentially exposed healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial for the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks in the healthcare setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of contact tracing through real-time locating systems (RTLS) and electronic medical records (EMRs) review at the designated hospital for COVID-19 response in Singapore, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Over a two-day study period, all admitted COVID-19 patients, their ward locations, and the HCWs rostered to each ward, were identified to determine the total number of potential contacts between COVID-19 patients and HCWs. The number of staff-patient contacts determined by EMR reviews, RTLS-based contact tracing, and a combination of both methods were evaluated. The use of EMR and RTLS-based contact tracing methods were further validated by comparing their sensitivity and specificity against self-reported staff-patient contacts by HCWs. RESULTS: Of 796 potential staff-patient contacts (between 17 patients and 162 staff), 104(13.1%) were identified on both RTLS and EMR, 54(6.8%) by RTLS alone, 99(12.4%) by EMR alone, and 539(67.7%) not identified through either method. Compared to self-reported contacts, EMR reviews had a sensitivity of 47.2% and specificity of 77.9%, while RTLS had a sensitivity of 72.2% and specificity of 87.7%. The highest sensitivity was obtained by including all contacts identified by either RTLS or EMR (sensitivity 77.8%, specificity 73.4%). CONCLUSIONS: RTLS-based contact tracing had higher sensitivity and specificity than EMR reviews. An integration of both methods provided the best performance for rapid contact tracing, although technical adjustments to the RTLS and increasing user compliance with wearing RTLS tags consistently remain necessary.

METHODS: The safety of the patients and department staff required a strict plan to minimize the risk of infection between operators whose absence would have made it impossible to carry out the radiotherapy treatments. The head of the radiotherapy unit and members of the Hospital Crisis Unit have put in place a series of measures to manage the emergency. RESULTS: A \"clean\" team has been established whose members are kept out of the radiotherapy unit for 2 weeks on rotation. Several separate work areas have been made in order to reduce direct contact between the staff. Each staff member has to wear protective equipment if close contact with patients is required. Before confirming a radiotherapy consult or a follow-up visit, telephone clinical and epidemiological screening is performed by nurses through a questionnaire regarding the presence of respiratory symptoms or eventual social contacts with COVID-19 positive people. Once the patients arrive in the hospital, a triage point at the entrance to the hospital performs a second screening and a temperature check. CONCLUSIONS: This management experience of a radiotherapy unit in Southern Italy could serve as a useful example for the future.

This is particularly true for an intensive care unit (ICU) where highly specialized staff cannot be readily replaced. In the light of lacking evidence for optimal staffing models in a pandemic, we hypothesized that staff shortage can be reduced when staff scheduling takes the epidemiology of a disease epidemic into account. METHODS: Various staffing models were constructed and comprehensive statistical modeling performed. A typical, routine staffing model was defined that assumed full-time employment (40 hours/week) in a 40 bed ICU with a 2:1 ratio of patients to staff. The pandemic model assumed staff worked 12-hour shifts for 7 days every other week. Potential in-hospital staff infections were constructed for a total period of 120 days with a probability of 10%, 25%, and 40% being infected per week when at work. Simulations included the probability of infection at work for a given week, of fatality once infected, and the quarantine time, if infected. RESULTS: Pandemic-adjusted staffing significantly reduced workforce shortage and the effect progressively increased as the probability of infection increased. Maximum effects were observed at week 4 for each infection probability with a 17%, 32%, and 38% staffing reduction for an infection probability of 0.10, 0.25, and 0.40, respectively.
