OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to illustrate the numerical effects of regulatory restrictions of elective surgery at an orthopaedic university hospital. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic all over the world places extraordinary demands on health care systems which are forced to ensure structural and personnel capacities. Consequently, hospitals may only perform urgent interventions. Spine patients, however, often need urgent surgery and, moreover, bear an above-average perioperative risk frequently requiring postoperative surveillance on intensive care units (ICUs). Facing this dilemma, we want to share our practice and its unexpected numerical effects. METHODS: We compare case statistics during normal operation, directly before and after implementation of regulatory measures. We also analyzed the differences in ICU utilization, complexity and duration of interventions and the patient population. RESULTS: Spine surgical interventions have been reduced by 42.7%. Regulatory restriction of \"elective surgeries\" in pandemic situations results in reduced ICU utilization, however in a disproportionate manner. Although other specialized surgeries can be reduced by 59%, surgical spine cases are only diminishable by 24%. The spine surgery-related ICU occupancy has been reduced by 35%.

METHODS: Using the GRADE system, published evidence was analyzed to generate weighted statements for stage, site, acuity of presentation and hospital setting to specify when surgery should be pursued, the time and duration of oncologically acceptable delays, and when to utilize non-surgical modalities to bridge the waiting period. RESULTS: Colorectal cancer surgeries - prioritized as emergency, urgent with (a) imminent emergency or (b) oncologically urgent, or elective - were matched against the phases of the pandemic.

(2) What will be the expected backlog of elective surgery over time? (3) How should health care change to address the backlog?

METHODS: Retrospective study of patients operated on in the previous month and during the peak of the pandemic.

RESULTS: From 17(th) February to 31(st) March 2020, there was a progressive decrease in surgical activity, with only 213 patients operated on. This comprised 59 (27.8%) elective operations for oncological diseases, 97 (45.5%) elective operations for benign diseases and 57 (26.7%) as urgent procedures. There was a progressive increase in the rate of infection by COVID-19, with a total of 15 cases (7%). This included 10 patients (16.9%) in the elective group for oncological disease, 1 (1%) in the elective surgery group for benign disease and 4 (7%) in the urgent surgery group (P<.001).
