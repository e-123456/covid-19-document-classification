Among the 1581 patients with ICU disposition data available as of March 25, 2020, 920 patients (58% [95% CI, 56%-61%]) were still in the ICU, 256 (16% [95% CI, 14%-18%]) were discharged from the ICU, and 405 (26% [95% CI, 23%-28%]) had died in the ICU. Older patients (n = 786; age >/=64 years) had higher mortality than younger patients (n = 795; age </=63 years) (36% vs 15%; difference, 21% [95% CI, 17%-26%]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICUs in Lombardy, Italy, the majority were older men, a large proportion required mechanical ventilation and high levels of PEEP, and ICU mortality was 26%."],"journal":"JAMA","authors":["Grasselli, Giacomo","Zangrillo, Alberto","Zanella, Alberto","Antonelli, Massimo","Cabrini, Luca","Castelli, Antonio","Cereda, Danilo","Coluccello, Antonio","Foti, Giuseppe","Fumagalli, Roberto","Iotti, Giorgio","Latronico, Nicola","Lorini, Luca","Merler, Stefano","Natalini, Giuseppe","Piatti, Alessandra","Ranieri, Marco Vito","Scandroglio, Anna Mara","Storti, Enrico","Cecconi, Maurizio","Pesenti, Antonio"],"date":"2020-04-07T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32250385","week":"202015|Apr 06 - Apr 12","doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.5394","source":"PubMed","locations":["Milan","China","Lombardy Region","Italy","Lombardy"],"countries":["China","Italy"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China","ITA|Italy"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1663352136244658176,"score":316.35495},{"pmid":32109279,"pmcid":"PMC7108195","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Imported Cases of COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province: A Multicenter Descriptive Study.","text":["Clinical Characteristics of Imported Cases of COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province: A Multicenter Descriptive Study.","BACKGROUND: We aimed to report the clinical characteristics of imported coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in Jiangsu Province. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with WHO interim guidance in three Grade A hospitals of Jiangsu from Jan 22 to Feb 14, 2020. Real time RT-PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples. RESULTS: Of the 80 patients infected with COVID-19, 41 patients were female, with a median age of 46.1 years. Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. 9 patients were unconfirmed until a third-time nucleic acid test. 38 cases had a history of chronic diseases. The main clinical manifestations of the patients were fever and cough, which accounted for 63 cases (78.75%) and 51 cases (-63.75%) respectively. Only 3 patients (3.75%) showed liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 55 patients (-68.75%) showed abnormal, 25 cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of both lungs. Up to now, 21 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patient died. The average length of stay for discharged patients was 8 days. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the cases in Wuhan, the cases in Jiangsu exhibited mild or moderate symptoms and no obvious gender susceptivity. The proportion of patients having liver dysfunction and abnormal CT imaging was relatively lower than that of Wuhan. Notably, infected patients may be falsely excluded based on two consecutively negative respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test results.","Clin Infect Dis","Wu, Jian","Liu, Jun","Zhao, Xinguo","Liu, Chengyuan","Wang, Wei","Wang, Dawei","Xu, Wei","Zhang, Chunyu","Yu, Jiong","Jiang, Bin","Cao, Hongcui","Li, Lanjuan","32109279"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: We aimed to report the clinical characteristics of imported coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in Jiangsu Province.
