Viremia was present in 1% of symptomatic adults. We identified 12 articles published between February 10(th) and April 4(th) 2020 reporting on 68 deliveries and 71 neonates with maternal infection in the third trimester of pregnancy. Perinatal exposure, including mode of delivery and time interval from delivery to the diagnosis of neonatal infection are crucial in differentiating congenital from perinatal infection. Neonatal infection is usually asymptomatic. Neonatal infection was diagnosed within 48 hours of life in 4 cases.
