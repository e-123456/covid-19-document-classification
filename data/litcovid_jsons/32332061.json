As part of the worldwide response, many molecular diagnostic platforms have been granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to identify SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Our objective was to evaluate three sample-to-answer molecular diagnostic platforms (Cepheid Xpert(R) Xpress SARS-CoV-2 [Xpert Xpress], Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 [ID NOW], GenMark ePlex(R) SARS-CoV-2 Test [ePlex]) to determine analytical sensitivity, clinical performance, and workflow for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs from 108 symptomatic patients. We found that the Xpert Xpress had the lowest limit of detection (100% detection at 100 copies/mL), followed by the ePlex (100% detection at 1,000 copies/mL), and the ID NOW (20,000 copies/mL). The Xpert Xpress also had highest positive percent agreement (PPA) when compared to our reference standard (98.3%) followed by the ePlex (91.4%) and ID now (87.7%). All three assays showed 100% negative percent agreement (NPA). In the workflow analysis, the ID NOW produced the most rapid time to result per specimen ( approximately 17 minutes) as compared to the Xpert Xpress ( approximately 46 minutes) and the ePlex ( approximately 1.5 hours), but what the ID NOW gained in rapid results, it lost in analytical and clinical performance. The ePlex had the longest time to results and showed a slight improvement in PPA over the ID NOW.

And, this assay was evaluated for its sensitivity and specificity of detection using real-time turbidity monitoring and visual observation. RESULTS: The primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123 amplified the genes in the shortest times, the mean (+/-SD) time was 18 +/- 1.32 min and 20 +/- 1.80 min, respectively, and 63 degrees C was the optimum reaction temperature. The sensitivity was 2x10(1) copies and 2x10(2) copies per reaction with primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123, respectively. This assay showed no cross-reactivity with other 60 respiratory pathogens.
