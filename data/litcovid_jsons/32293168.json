Because no specific drugs or vaccines for COVID-19 are yet available, early diagnosis and management are crucial for containing the outbreak.

In addition, the FET sensor successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 in culture medium (limit of detection [LOD]: 1.6 x 10(1) pfu/ml) and clinical samples (LOD: 2.42 x 10(2) copies/ml).
