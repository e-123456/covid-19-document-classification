There is no proven medication for its treatment, so, all of the medications used for treatment are considered to be off-label. Off-label uses are not under regulation in the outbreak because there is no specific regulation for this condition. OBJECTIVES: In this short communication we aim at describing two ways of off-label use as clinical practice or investigational use. Further, we will describe the third way of off-label use, we named it pseudo-research and then we will state the most possible ethical challenges of off-label use for better perceptions and responsibility. RESULTS: The WHO considers off-label uses as country-specific. All international regulatory bodies consider off-label prescription as the physician's responsibility and legal by necessitating some requirements. There is no international guideline for regulating investigational off-label uses as clinical practice. CONCLUSION: There are different types of approaches, none of them is comprehensive and conclusive. Furthermore, respecting the four ethical principles necessitates codification and strict regulation of off-label uses either as clinical practice or investigational. Besides, compilation of a special guideline based on ethical principles especially non-maleficence and autonomy for investigational off-label uses in disasters is highly recommended.","Daru","Shojaei, Amirahmad","Salari, Pooneh","32385829"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak is rapidly spread over the world and kills infected patients.

Off-label prescribing (i.e. for a non-approved indication) is legal in most countries, and tends to shift the burden of liability or cost to physicians and patients, respectively. Nevertheless, health crises may mean that real-world repurposing is the only realistic source of solutions. Optimal real-world repurposing requires a track record of safety, affordability, and access for drug candidates. Although thousands of such drugs are already available, there is no central repository of off-label uses to facilitate immediate identification and selection of potentially useful interventions during public health crises. Using the current COVID-19 pandemic as an example, we provide a glimpse of the extensive literature that supports the rationale behind six generic drugs, in four classes, all of which are affordable, supported by decades of safety data, and target the underlying pathophysiology that makes COVID-19 so deadly. This paper briefly summarizes why cimetidine or famotidine, dipyridamole, fenofibrate or bezafibrate, and sildenafil citrate, are worth considering for patients with COVID-19. Clinical trials to assess efficacy are already underway for famotidine, dipyridamole, and sildenafil, and further trials of all these agents will be important in due course. These examples also reveal the unlimited opportunity to future-proof our healthcare systems by proactively mining, synthesizing, cataloging, and evaluating the off-label treatment opportunities of thousands of safe, well established, and affordable generic drugs.","JMIR Public Health Surveill","Rogosnitzky, Moshe","Berkowitz, Esther","Jadad, Alejandro R","32374264"],"abstract":["UNSTRUCTURED: Real-world drug repurposing - the immediate 'off-label' prescribing of drugs to address urgent clinical need - is a widely overlooked opportunity.
