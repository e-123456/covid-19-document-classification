OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) by stratifying the comorbidity status.

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.

Human-to-human transmission is confirmed, and this disease (named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO)) spread rapidly around the country and the world. As of 18 February 2020, the number of confirmed cases had reached 75,199 with 2009 fatalities. The COVID-19 resulted in a much lower case-fatality rate (about 2.67%) among the confirmed cases, compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Among the symptom composition of the 45 fatality cases collected from the released official reports, the top four are fever, cough, short of breath, and chest tightness/pain. The major comorbidities of the fatality cases include hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction, and chronic bronchitis. The source of the virus and the pathogenesis of this disease are still unconfirmed. No specific therapeutic drug has been found. The Chinese Government has initiated a level-1 public health response to prevent the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, it is also crucial to speed up the development of vaccines and drugs for treatment, which will enable us to defeat COVID-19 as soon as possible."],"journal":"J Clin Med","authors":["Deng, Sheng-Qun","Peng, Hong-Juan"],"date":"2020-02-26T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32093211","week":"20209|Feb 24 - Mar 01","doi":"10.3390/jcm9020575","keywords":["2019-nCoV","COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2","clinical characteristics","coronavirus","diagnosis","pneumonia","prevention and control","public health","treatment"],"source":"PubMed","locations":["China","Hubei","Wuhan"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Treatment","Prevention","Mechanism","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1662334544313843712,"score":198.01697}]}
