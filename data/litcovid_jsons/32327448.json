In the workflow analysis, the ID NOW produced the most rapid time to result per specimen ( approximately 17 minutes) as compared to the Xpert Xpress ( approximately 46 minutes) and the ePlex ( approximately 1.5 hours), but what the ID NOW gained in rapid results, it lost in analytical and clinical performance.

METHODS: Sixty-one COVID-19 patients and 64 patients from a control group were tested by iFlash1800 CLIA analyzer for anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies IgM and IgG. All COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in San Giovanni di Dio Hospital (Florence, Italy) and had a positive oro/nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR result. RESULTS: The highest sensitivity with a very good specificity performance was reached at a cutoff value of 10.0 AU/mL for IgM and of 7.1 for IgG antibodies, hence near to the manufacturer's cutoff values of 10 AU/mL for both isotypes.
