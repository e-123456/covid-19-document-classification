RESULTS: In our experience the most important sequelae of severe and critical forms of COVID-19 are: 1) respiratory; 2) cognitive, central and peipheral nervous system; 3) deconditioning; 4) critical illness related myopathy and neuropathy; 5) dysphagia; 6) joint stiffness and pain; 7) psychiatric.

Second, suggested procedures regarding design of an inpatient rehabilitation unit for COVID-19 survivors, staffing issues, and considerations for outpatient rehabilitation have been made. Third, guidelines for rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology) following COVID-19 have been made, with respect to recovery of the respiratory system as well as mobility and function.
