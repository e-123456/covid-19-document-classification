We surveyed neurosurgeons worldwide to investigate the situation they are experiencing. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A 17-question, web-based survey was administered to neurosurgeons worldwide through the WFNS and the Neurosurgery Cocktail from March 28 to April 5, 2020 by web link or e-mail invitation. Questions were divided into three subgroups: general information, health system organization, and institutional plans for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Collected data was initially elaborated using Survey Monkey(R) software. Country specific data were extracted from the WHO website. Statistical analysis was performed using R version 3.6.3. RESULTS: Of the 446 respondents, most were from Italy (20%), India (19%), and Pakistan (5%). Surgical activity was significantly reduced in most centers (79%) and dedicated in-hospital routes were created for SARS-CoV-2 patients (58%). Patient screening was performed only when there were symptoms (57%) and not routinely before surgery (18%). The preferred methods included a nasopharyngeal swab and chest x-ray. Health professionals were rarely screened (20%) and sometimes, even if SARS-CoV-2 positive, were asked to work if asymptomatic (26%). Surgical planning was changed in most institutions (92%), while indications were modified for non-urgent procedures (59%) and remained unchanged for subarachnoid hemorrhages (85%).
