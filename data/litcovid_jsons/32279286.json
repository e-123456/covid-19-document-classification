METHODS: Consecutive cases over 60 years old with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 1 to Feb 6, 2020 were included. The primary outcomes were death and survival till March 5. Data of demographics, clinical features, comorbidities, laboratory tests and complications were collected and compared for different outcomes. Cox regression was performed for prognostic factors. RESULTS: 339 patients with COVID-19 (aged 71+/-8 years,173 females (51%)) were enrolled, including 80 (23.6%) critical, 159 severe (46.9%) and 100 moderate (29.5%) cases. Common comorbidities were hypertension (40.8%), diabetes (16.0%) and cardiovascular disease (15.7%). Common symptoms included fever (92.0%), cough (53.0%), dyspnea (40.8%) and fatigue (39.9%). Lymphocytopenia was a common laboratory finding (63.2%). Common complications included bacterial infection (42.8%), liver enzyme abnormalities (28.7%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (21.0%). Till Mar 5, 2020, 91 cases were discharged (26.8%), 183 cases stayed in hospital (54.0%) and 65 cases (19.2%) were dead. Shorter length of stay was found for the dead compared with the survivors (5 (3-8) vs. 28 (26-29), P < 0.001). Symptoms of dyspnea (HR 2.35, P=0.001), comorbidities including cardiovascular disease (HR 1.86, P=0.031) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 2.24, P=0.023), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (HR 29.33, P < 0.001) were strong predictors of death. And a high level of lymphocytes was predictive of better outcome (OR=0.10, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderly COVID-19 patients. Rapid disease progress was noted in the dead with a median survival time of 5 days after admission. Dyspnea, lymphocytopenia, comorbidities including cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome were predictive of poor outcome. Close monitoring and timely treatment should be performed for the elderly patients at high risk.","J Infect","Wang, Lang","He, Wenbo","Yu, Xiaomei","Hu, Dalong","Bao, Mingwei","Liu, Huafen","Zhou, Jiali","Jiang, Hong","32240670"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics and prognostic factors in the elderly patients with COVID-19.

The outbreak was attributed to a novel coronavirus (CoV), named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and the disease as COVID-19. Within one month, cases were reported from 25 countries. In view of the novel viral strain with reported high morbidity, establishing early countrywide diagnosis to detect imported cases became critical. Here we describe the role of a countrywide network of VRDLs in early diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: : The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, established screening as well as confirmatory assays for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 13 VRDLs were provided with the E gene screening real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. VRDLs were selected on the basis of their presence near an international airport/seaport and their past performance. The case definition for testing included all individuals with travel history to Wuhan and symptomatic individuals with travel history to other parts of China. This was later expanded to include symptomatic individuals returning from Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and South Korea. Results: : Within a week of standardization of the test at NIV, all VRDLs could initiate testing for SARS-CoV-2. Till February 29, 2020, a total of 2,913 samples were tested. This included both 654 individuals quarantined in the two camps and others fitting within the case definition. The quarantined individuals were tested twice - at days 0 and 14. All tested negative on both occasions. Only three individuals belonging to different districts in Kerala were found to be positive. Interpretation & conclusions: : Sudden emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential to cause a pandemic posed an unsurmountable challenge to the public health system of India. However, concerted efforts of various arms of the Government of India resulted in a well-coordinated action at each level. India has successfully demonstrated its ability to establish quick diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 at NIV, Pune, and the testing VRDLs.","Indian J Med Res","Gupta, Nivedita","Potdar, Varsha","Praharaj, Ira","Giri, Sidhartha","Sapkal, Gajanan","Yadav, Pragya","Choudhary, Manohar Lal","Dar, Lalit","Sugunan, A P","Kaur, Harmanmeet","Munivenkatappa, Ashok","Shastri, Jayanthi","Kaveri, Krishnasamy","Dutta, Shanta","Malhotra, Bharti","Jain, Amita","Nagamani, Kammilli","Shantala, G B","Raut, Sharmila","Vegad, M M","Sharma, Ajanta","Choudhary, Aashish","Brijwal, Megha","Balakrishnan, Anukumar","Manjunatha, Jayaswamy","Pathak, Manish","Srinivasan, Sivasubramanian","Banu, Hasina","Sharma, Himanshu","Jain, Parul","Sunita, Pakalpati","Ambica, R","Fageria, Babita","Patel, Disha","Rajbongshi, Gitika","Vijay, Neetu","Narayan, Jitendra","Aggarwal, Neeraj","Nagar, Anu","Gangakhedkar, Raman R","Abraham, Priya","32242875"],"abstract":["Background & objectives: : An outbreak of respiratory illness of unknown aetiology was reported from Hubei province of Wuhan, People's Republic of China, in December 2019.
