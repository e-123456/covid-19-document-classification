Here, we summarized the composition of pathogens in fever clinic patients and analyzed characteristics of different respiratory virus infection.

RESULTS: Totally, 1860 patients were screened and 136 patients were enrolled. 72 (52.94%) of them were diagnosed as influenza (Flu) A virus infection. 32 (23.53%) of them were diagnosed as Flu B virus infection. 18 (13.24%) and 14 (10.29%) of them were diagnosed as COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection respectively. COVID-19 group had a higher rate of contact with epidemic area within 14 days and clustering onset than other groups. Fever was the most common symptom in these patients. The ratio of fever and the highest temperature were higher in Flu A virus infection patients than in COVID-19 patients.
