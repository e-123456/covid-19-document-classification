WHO declared a state of pandemic (11th March, 2020), which has caused more than 1 million infected and more than 110,000 deaths; it was observed that up to 29% of those infected were health care personnel.

The pandemic induced an international saturation of health care services and a rupture in the supply chain of protective equipment for healthcare personnel, which poses a high occupational risk to all.
