In this concise review we queried on the effects of corticosteroids in pregnancies complicated by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We performed a literature search on PubMed, regarding the use of corticosteroids in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, in pregnancies complicated by SARS-CoV-2, as well as their impact on glycemia in pregnant women with or without diabetes. Furthermore, we searched for effects of SARS-CoV-2 and of other coronaviridae on insulin secretion and glycemia. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be a risk factor for complications in pregnancy. Corticosteroids may not be recommended for treating SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia but they may be needed for at-risk pregnancies. Corticosteroids in pregnancy have a diabetogenic potential.
