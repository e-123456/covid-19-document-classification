In all cases, these are zoonoses passing the barrier between species and infect humans. The legitimate concern of the international community is due to the fact that the new identified coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 (previously called 2019-nCoV), has a quite high mortality rate, around 2%, and a strong ability to spread, with an estimated reproduction number higher than 2. Even though all countries are doing their utmost to stop the pandemic, the only reliable solution to tackle the infection is the rapid development of a vaccine.
