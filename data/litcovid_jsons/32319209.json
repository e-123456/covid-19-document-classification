Therefore, the aim of the review is to collect and discuss aspects of the management of patients in oral and maxillofacial surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to save resources and to avoid unnecessary exposure to infected patients, there is the need to schedule interventions depending on their priority. During the peak of the pandemic, no elective surgery should be performed. Even urgent procedures might be postponed if there is a view to recovery of a COVID-19 patient within a few days. Emergency procedures do not allow any delay. Specialties with overlap in therapies should have well defined arrangements among each other concerning the treatment spectra in order to avoid redundancy and loss of resources. Inpatient and outpatient units have to be organized in such a way that the risk of cross-infection among patients is reduced to a minimum. Especially, testing of patients for SARS-CoV-2 is important to detect the infected patients at an early stage. When surgery is performed on COVID-19 patients, adequate personal protective equipment is crucial. There must be negative pressure in the operating room, and aerosol formation must be reduced to a minimum. In order to address the COVID-19 challenge adequately, significant changes in the infrastructure of outpatient units, inpatient units, and operating rooms are needed. In addition, the demands concerning personal protective equipment increase significantly. The major aim is to protect patients as well as the medical staff from unnecessary infection, and to keep the healthcare system running effectively.
