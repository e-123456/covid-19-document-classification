In this review, we discuss overall infection risks of non-biologic and biologic systemic medications for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and provide therapeutic recommendations. In summary, in patients with active infection, systemic conventional medications, the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib, and biologics for psoriasis should be temporarily held until there is more data; in uninfected patients switching to safer alternatives should be considered.

Pivotal trials and postmarketing data also suggest that IL-17 and IL-23 blockers are safer than TNF-blockers. Apremilast, acitretin and dupilumab, have favorable safety data, and may be safely initiated and continued in uninfected patients.
