The declaration of a pandemic posed challenges to many countries, prominent among them communication with the public to gain its cooperation.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the Israeli Public's response to the Israeli government's emergency instructions against the pandemic in terms of correlations between: (1) overall risk perceptions and crisis management, (2) overall risk perceptions and economic threat, (3) crisis management and the compliance to behavioral guidelines, (4) crisis management and economic threat, and comparisons between (1) crisis management and spokesperson credibility, and (2) crisis management and source of information credibility. METHODS: The sample was planned using a Qualtrics XM online survey that provided the quick and effective distribution of an online questionnaire during the COVID-19 crisis. Self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit participants (n=1056) through social network posts calling on the general public (18+) to answer the survey. RESULTS: Participants aged 65+ perceived higher personal risk compared to aged 18-30 (mean difference 0.33, 95% CI 0.04-0.61) and compared to aged 46-64 (mean difference 0.38, 95% CI=0.12-0.64). Significant correlations were found between: (1) overall risk perceptions and the attitudes towards crisis management (r=0.19, p<0.001), (2) overall risk perceptions and economic threat (r=0.22, p<0.001), (3) attitudes towards crisis management and the compliance to behavioral guidelines (r=0.15, p<0.001), (4) attitudes towards crisis management and economic threat (r=-0.15, p<0.001).
