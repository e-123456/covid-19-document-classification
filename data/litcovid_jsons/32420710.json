There has been urgent need to determine clinical characteristics of Polish patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the clinical setting. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this retrospective study was to outline characteristics and short-term outcomes of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively characterized 169 consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19, with regard to their: clinical manifestations, radiological findings, treatment, complications and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 169 patients, more than half was aged 65 (n=88, 52,1%) or above, 51,5% were male and 78,3% had comorbidities. Majority of patients (n=106, 62.7%) were transferred from outbreak locations in medical facilities. The most common symptoms on admission were fever (42%), shortness of breath (35%) and fatigue (33%). 27 (15.4%) of patients required intensive care unit admission. Overall mortality was 26.3% (n=46) and was significantly higher in patients transferred from other facilities (38 out of 106, 35.8%), than in patients admitted directly to the hospital (8 out of 63, 12.69%, p<0.001). 17 out of 29 patients admitted to ICU died (mortality = 58,6%), including 30 out of 41 patients with ARDS (73.2% mortality rate in ARDS patients).
