In the absence of evidence, individual communities had to take timely action to reduce the rate of disease spread and avoid overburdening their healthcare systems. Although a few predictive models have been published to guide these decisions, most have not taken into account spatial differences and have included assumptions that do not match the local realities. Access to reliable information that is adapted to local context is critical for policymakers to make informed decisions during a rapidly evolving pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop an adapted susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to predict the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina (NC) and the Charlotte metropolitan region and to incorporate the effect of a public health intervention to reduce disease spread, while accounting for unique regional features and imperfect detection. METHODS: Using the software package R, three SIR models were fit to infection prevalence data from the state and the greater Charlotte region and then rigorously compared. One of these models (SIR-Int) accounted for a stay-at-home intervention and imperfect detection of COVID-19 cases. We computed longitudinal total estimates of the susceptible, infected, and removed compartments of both populations, along with other pandemic characteristics (e.g., basic reproduction number). RESULTS: Prior to March 26, disease spread was rapid at the pandemic onset with the Charlotte region doubling time of 2.56 days (95% CI: (2.11, 3.25)) and in NC 2.94 days (95% CI: (2.33, 4.00)). Subsequently, disease spread significantly slowed with doubling times increased in the Charlotte region to 4.70 days (95% CI: (3.77, 6.22)) and in NC to 4.01 days (95% CI: (3.43, 4.83)). Reflecting spatial differences, this deceleration favored the greater Charlotte region compared to NC as a whole. A comparison of the efficacy of intervention, defined as 1 - the hazard ratio of infection, gave 0.25 for NC and 0.43 for the Charlotte region. Also, early in the pandemic, the initial basic SIR model had good fit to the data; however, as the pandemic and local conditions evolved, the SIR-Int model emerged as the model with better fit. CONCLUSIONS: Using local data and continuous attention to model adaptation, our findings have enabled policymakers, public health officials and health systems to proactively plan capacity and evaluate the impact of a public health intervention. Our SIR-Int model for estimated latent prevalence was reasonably flexible, highly accurate, and demonstrated the efficacy of a stay-at-home order at both the state and regional level.

There is great uncertainty regarding how countries' characteristics will affect the spread of the epidemic; to date, there are few studies that attempt to predict the spread of the epidemic in African countries. In this paper, we investigate the role of demographic patterns, urbanisation and comorbidities on the possible trajectories of COVID-19 in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal. METHODS: We use an augmented deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to predict the true spread of the disease, under the containment measures taken so far. We disaggregate the infected compartment into asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic and severely symptomatic to match observed clinical development of COVID-19. We also account for age structures, urbanisation and comorbidities (HIV, tuberculosis, anaemia). RESULTS: In our baseline model, we project that the peak of active cases will occur in July, subject to the effectiveness of policy measures.

Our setting was Italy, and especially Lombardy, which is experiencing a heavy burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The peak of new daily cases of the epidemic has been reached on the 29th, while was delayed in Central and Southern Italian regions compared to Northern ones. In our models, we estimated the basic reproduction number (R0), which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection, both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period and also by using day-by-day assessments based on single observations. We used the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading of the pandemic in Italy. The two methods provide an agreement of values, although the first method based on exponential fit should provide a better estimation, being computed on the entire time series. Taking into account the growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period, each infected person in Lombardy has involved 4 other people (3.6 based on data of April 23rd) compared to a value of R0 = 2.68, as reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan. According to our model, Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Marche will reach an R0 value of up to 3.5.

The R0 value is decreased in Lombardy and the Northern regions, while it is increased in Central and Southern regions. The expected peak of the SEIR model is set at the end of March, at a national level, with Southern Italian regions reaching the peak in the first days of April.
