But no studies to date have systematically described liver test abnormalities in patients with COVID-19. We evaluated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with abnormal liver tests. METHODS: Clinical records and laboratory results were obtained from 417 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China from January 11 to February 21, 2020 and followed up to March 7, 2020. Information of clinical features of patients with abnormal liver tests were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Of 417 patients with COVID-19, 318 (76.3%) had abnormal liver test results and 90 (21.5%) had liver injury during hospitalization. The presence of abnormal liver tests became more pronounced during hospitalization within 2 weeks, with 49 (23.4%), 31 (14.8%), 24 (11.5%) and 51 (24.4%) patients raising liver enzyme levels to more than 3 times of upper limit units in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin and gamma-glutamyl transferase, respectively. Patients with abnormal liver test of hepatocellular type or mixed type at admission had higher odds of progressing to severe disease (odds ratios (OR)=2.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-6.3, and 4.44, 95% CI 1.93-10.23, respectively). The use of lopinavir/ritonavir was also found to lead to increased odds of liver injury (OR from 4.44 to 5.03, both P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients with abnormal liver tests had higher risks of progressing to severe disease. The detrimental effects on liver injury mainly related to certain medications used during hospitalization, should be monitored and evaluated frequently.","J Hepatol","Cai, Qingxian","Huang, Deliang","Yu, Hong","Zhu, Zhibin","Xia, Zhang","Su, Yinan","Li, Zhiwei","Zhou, Guangde","Gou, Jizhou","Qu, Jiuxin","Sun, Yan","Liu, Yingxia","He, Qing","Chen, Jun","Liu, Lei","Xu, Lin","32298767"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND & AIMS: Recent data on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has begun to shine light on the impact of the disease on the liver.

The clinical characteristics, influencing factors and prognosis of liver injury in patients with liver injury group and those with normal liver function group were compared. The mean of two samples in univariate analysis was compared by t-test and analysis of variance. The counting data was measured by chi(2) tests. The non-normal distribution measurement data were described by the median, and the non-parametric test was used. Statistically significant influencing factors were used as the independent variables in univariate analysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the main influencing factors of liver injury. Results: Of the 40 cases, 25 were male (62.5%) and 15 were female (37.5%), aged 22 to 83 (53.87 +/- 15.84) years. Liver injury was occurred in 22 cases (55%) during the course of the disease. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was initially increased (4.4 to 3.5 times of the normal value) along with decrease of albumin in the second week, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Ten cases (43.5%) had highest abnormal total blood bilirubin (54.1 mumol/ L). There was no correlation between the increase in transaminase and the increase in total blood bilirubin (R = -0.006, P = 0.972).

Liver function injury was more likely to occur in patients who used many types of drugs and large amounts of hormones (P = 0.002, P = 0.031), and there was no correlation with the TA6TA7 mutation in the UGT1A1 * 28 gene locus.
