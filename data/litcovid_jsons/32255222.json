BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a major threat to public health. Nurses have always played an important role in infection prevention, infection control, isolation, containment, and public health. However, available data on the work stress among these nurses is limited. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey. An online questionnaire was completed by 180 anti-epidemic nurses from Guangxi. Data collection tools, including the Chinese version of the Stress Overload Scale (SOS) and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Descriptive, single factor, correlation, and multiple regression analyses were used in exploring related influencing factors. RESULTS: The SOS (39.91+/-12.92) and SAS scores (32.19+/-7.56) of this nurse group were positively correlated (r=0.676, p<0.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that only children, working hours per week, and anxiety were the main factors affecting nurse stress (p=0.000, 0.048, 0.000, respectively).

In Cluster A, urine/feces splash, sex, and sputum splash were independent predictive factors. In Cluster B, fall of protective glasses and urine/feces splash were independent predictive factors. In Cluster C, urine/feces splash and urine/feces clearance were independent predictive factors. CONCLUSION: The ICU nurses in Wuhan showed varying and overlapping SSDs. These SSDs could be classified into three symptom clusters. Based on the characteristics of their SSDs, specific interventions could be implemented to safeguard the health of ICU nurses."],"journal":"J Pain Symptom Manage","authors":["Yifan, Tang","Ying, Liu","Chunhong, Gao","Jing, Song","Rong, Wang","Zhenyu, Li","Zejuan, Gu","Peihung, Liao"],"date":"2020-04-11T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32276095","week":"202015|Apr 06 - Apr 12","doi":"10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.039","keywords":["COVID-19","Intensive Care Units","Occupational exposure","Symptom Cluster","Symptoms"],"source":"PubMed","locations":["Wuhan","China","Wuhan","Wuhan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1663712077931347968,"score":334.8675}]}
