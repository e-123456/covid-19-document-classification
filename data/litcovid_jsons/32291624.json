As the epicentre of the initial outbreak, China has been updating the National COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guideline with up-to-date information about the disease. To facilitate the implementation of integrative Chinese-Western Medicine in COVID-19 management, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been recommended in recent editions of the national guideline. Methods: The national guideline summarised the opinions and frontline experience of medical experts across the country to provide by far the best management for COVID-19. We extracted the case definition and clinical classifications of COVID-19 in China along with relevant TCM treatments cited in the seventh edition of the guideline, with an intend to disseminate practical information to TCM practitioners and researchers around the world. Results: We presented the most recent case definition, clinical classifications, and relevant TCM treatments of COVID-19 in accordance to recommendations of the Chinese guideline. TCM treatments are stratified into two groups based on patients' disease status. Four types of Chinese patent medicines are recommended for suspected COVID-19 cases. Several herbal formulae are recommended for confirmed COVID-19 cases according to their clinical classification and TCM pattern diagnoses. Two herbal formulae are also recommended for rehabilitation of recovering cases. Conclusion: To control the waves of COVID-19 outbreak, countries must ensure the adherence of their citizens to local public health measures. Medical professionals should diagnose and treat patients according to up-to-date guidelines. Future evaluation of the outcomes of implementing TCM recommendations will strengthen the evidence base for COVID-19 management for the sake of public health and the internationalisation of TCM.","Eur J Integr Med","Ho, Leonard T F","Chan, Karina K H","Chung, Vincent C H","Leung, Ting Hung","32292529"],"abstract":["Introduction: The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic on 11 March 2020, after the number of confirmed cases outside China increased 13-fold.
