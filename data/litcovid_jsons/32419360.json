MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated glycemic control of individuals with T1DM using HCL system in the period before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy (February 10th - 23rd, 2020 - Time 1), when movements were only reduced (February 24th - March 8th, 2020 - Time 2) and during complete lockdown (March 9th-22nd, 2020 - Time 3). Information about regular PA (at least 3 hours per week) prior and during the quarantine were collected.

There is no information about the effects of tight glycemic control on Covid-19 outcomes in patients with hyperglycemia. Therefore, we examined the effects of optimal glycemic control in patients with hyperglycemia affected by Covid-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with Covid-19 hospitalized with moderate disease were evaluated. On the basis of admission glycemia >7.77 mmol/L, patients were divided into hyperglycemic and normoglycemic groups. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and D-dimer levels were evaluated at admission and weekly during hospitalization. The composite end point was severe disease, admission to an intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: Thirty-four (57.6%) patients were normoglycemic and 25 (42.4%) were hyperglycemic. In the hyperglycemic group, 7 (28%) and 18 (72%) patients were diagnosed with diabetes already before admission, and 10 (40%) and 15 (60%) were treated without and with insulin infusion, respectively. The mean of glycemia during hospitalization was 10.65 +/- 0.84 mmol/L in the no insulin infusion group and 7.69 +/- 1.85 mmol/L in the insulin infusion group. At baseline, IL-6 and D-dimer levels were significantly higher in the hyperglycemic group than in the normoglycemic group (P < 0.001). Despite that all patients were on standard treatment for Covid-19 infection, IL-6 and D-dimer levels persisted higher in patients with hyperglycemia during hospitalization. In a risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis, both patients with hyperglycemia and patients with diabetes had a higher risk of severe disease than those without diabetes and with normoglycemia.
