There has been a drastic decrease in liver donors. From February 23(rd) until April 10th, 17 LTs were performed in Lombardy. Mean donor age was 49 years (range 18-74) whereas mean recipient age was 55 (13-69); mean MELD Score was 12 (6-24). All donors underwent screening for SARS CoV-2 prior to LT.
