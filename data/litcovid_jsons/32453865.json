OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical and pathologic findings of pernio-like lesions in confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases.

RESULTS: We documented 505 patients with dermatologic manifestations associated with COVID-19, including 318 (63%) with pernio-like lesions. Patients with pernio-like lesions were generally young and healthy, with relatively mild COVID-19.
