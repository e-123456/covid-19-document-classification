Discontinuation of radiation treatments is not desirable and potentially life-threatening. On the other hand, accesses to hospital expose cancer patients to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. We report our extended protocol, draft to manage clinical activities in our radiotherapy department, by minimizing contagion risks. METHODS: We used telephonic screening to assess the need for patient admission. A telephonic triage was performed to identify the presence of COVID-19 infection risk factors or symptoms. New treatments were stratified according to priority codes. A reserved entrance to radiotherapy department was assured for patients and staff. Surgical disposable mask was required for patients and caregivers. The activities were distributed during the whole workday, avoiding overlap to reduce aggregation. RESULTS: From 1st February 2020 to 31 March 2020, we reported an increase in the number of first medical examinations and treatments, compared to the same period of the previous year.

The aim of this paper is to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hip and knee arthroplasties in an Italian high-volume orthopedic center, located in the region of the country first and worst affected by the Coronavirus. METHODS: Data from an institutional database were retrospectively analyzed to obtain the number of hip and knee arthroplasties performed from February 24 to April 10 2020. The figures were compared with those of the same 7-week period of the last year (2019). RESULTS: The number of hip and knee arthroplasties showed a decrease from 706 in the same period of 2019 to 166 (76.5% less) in the current year. In 2019, a mean of 101 +/- 9 hip and knee arthroplasties were performed per week compared with a mean of 24 +/- 34 in 2020. Ten patients tested positive for SARS-CoV2 during their hospital stay. Two of these patients died after a regular postoperative period after developing unexpectedly COVID-19 during rehabilitation. The mortality in the 7-week period of the current year was 1.2% compared with 0% in 2019. CONCLUSION: The outbreak of COVID-19 had a considerable effect in our center on the number of hip and knee arthroplasties that rapidly decreased to 0 in parallel to the worsening of the situation in the country. Efforts will be soon requested because our practice is going to deal with the after-effects of the pandemic in the near future.","J Arthroplasty","D'Apolito, Rocco","Faraldi, Martina","Ottaiano, Immacolata","Zagra, Luigi","32370923"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has put strain on many healthcare systems around the world, with important consequences.
