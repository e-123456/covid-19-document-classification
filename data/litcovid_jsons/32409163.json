The aim of this report is to share our protocol for performing a safe surgical tracheotomy in COVID-19 patients. Infection of the nursing/medical staff involved in the first 30 tracheotomies performed in patients affected by COVID-19 in the Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary referral center were evaluated. Mistakes that occurred during surgery were analyzed and discussed. None of the nursing/medical staff presented signs or symptoms of COVID-19 within 15 days after the procedure.

MAIN BODY: The tracheotomy procedure is highly aerosol generating and directly exposes the entire surgical team to the viral aerosol plume and secretions, thereby increasing the risk of transmission to healthcare providers. As such, we believe extended endotracheal intubation should be the standard of care for the entire duration of ventilation in the vast majority of patients. Pre-operative COVID-19 testing is highly recommended for any non-emergent procedure.
