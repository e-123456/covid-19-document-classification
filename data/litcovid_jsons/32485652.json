In the absence of a vaccine, or an approved effective therapeutic, there is an intense interest in repositioning available drugs or designing small molecule antivirals. In this context, in silico modelling has proven to be an invaluable tool. An important target is the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)), involved in processing translated viral proteins. Peptidomimetic alpha-ketoamides represent prototypical inhibitors of M(pro). A recent attempt at designing a compound with enhanced pharmacokinetic properties has resulted in the synthesis and evaluation of the alpha-ketoamide 13b analogue. Here, we performed molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to further characterize the interaction of alpha-ketoamide 13b with the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). We included the widely used antibiotic, amoxicillin, for comparison. Our findings indicate that alpha-ketoamide 13b binds more tightly (predicted GlideScore = -8.7 and -9.2kcal/mol for protomers A and B, respectively), to the protease active site compared to amoxicillin (-5.0 and -4.8kcal/mol). Further, molecular dynamics simulations highlight the stability of the interaction of the alpha-ketoamide 13b ligand with the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) (DeltaG = -25.2 and -22.3kcal/mol for protomers A and B). In contrast, amoxicillin interacts unfavourably with the protease (DeltaG = +32.8kcal/mol for protomer A), with unbinding events observed in several independent simulations.
