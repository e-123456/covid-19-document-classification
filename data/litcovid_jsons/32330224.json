Many institutions are developing ventilator triage policies. Objective: To characterize the development of ventilator triage policies and compare policy content. Design: Survey and mixed-methods content analysis. Setting: North American hospitals associated with members of the Association of Bioethics Program Directors. Participants: Program directors. Measurements: Characteristics of institutions and policies, including triage criteria and triage committee membership. Results: Sixty-seven program directors responded (response rate, 91.8%); 36 (53.7%) hospitals did not yet have a policy, and 7 (10.4%) hospitals' policies could not be shared. The 29 institutions providing policies were relatively evenly distributed among the 4 U.S. geographic regions (range, 5 to 9 policies per region). Among the 26 unique policies analyzed, 3 (11.3%) were produced by state health departments. The most frequently cited triage criteria were benefit (25 policies [96.2%]), need (14 [53.8%]), age (13 [50.0%]), conservation of resources (10 [38.5%]), and lottery (9 [34.6%]). Twenty-one (80.8%) policies use scoring systems, and 20 of these (95.2%) use a version of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Among the policies that specify the triage team's composition (23 [88.5%]), all require or recommend a physician member, 20 (87.0%) a nurse, 16 (69.6%) an ethicist, 8 (34.8%) a chaplain, and 8 (34.8%) a respiratory therapist. Thirteen (50.0% of all policies) require or recommend those making triage decisions not be involved in direct patient care, but only 2 (7.7%) require that their decisions be blinded to ethically irrelevant considerations. Limitation: The results may not be generalizable to institutions without academic bioethics programs. Conclusion: Over one half of respondents did not have ventilator triage policies. Policies have substantial heterogeneity, and many omit guidance on fair implementation.","Ann Intern Med","Matheny Antommaria, Armand H","Gibb, Tyler S","McGuire, Amy L","Wolpe, Paul Root","Wynia, Matthew K","Applewhite, Megan K","Caplan, Arthur","Diekema, Douglas S","Hester, D Micah","Lehmann, Lisa Soleymani","McLeod-Sordjan, Renee","Schiff, Tamar","Tabor, Holly K","Wieten, Sarah E","Eberl, Jason T","32330224"],"abstract":["Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has or threatens to overwhelm health care systems.

This study aimed to predict the development of the epidemic with specific interventional policies applied in China and evaluate their effectiveness. METHODS: COVID-19 data of Hubei Province and the next five most affected provinces were collected from daily case reports of COVID-19 on the Health Committee official website of these provinces. The number of current cases, defined as the number of confirmed cases minus the number of cured cases and those who have died, was examined in this study. A modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious- Removed (SEIR) model was used to assess the effects of interventional policies on the epidemic. In this study, January 28 was day zero of the model. RESULTS: The results of the modified SEIR model showed that the number of current cases in Hubei and Zhejiang provinces tended to be stabilized after 70 days and after 60 days in the four other provinces. The predicted number of current cases without policy intervention was shown to far exceed that with policy intervention. The estimated number of COVID-19 cases in Hubei Province with policy intervention was predicted to peak at 51,222, whereas that without policy intervention was predicted to reach 157,721.
