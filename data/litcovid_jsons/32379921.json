Given that patients with cancer are generally more vulnerable to infections, systematic analysis of diverse cohorts of patients with cancer affected by COVID-19 are needed. We performed a multi-center study including 105 cancer patients and 536 age-matched non-cancer patients confirmed with COVID-19. Our results showed COVID-19 patients with cancer had higher risks in all severe outcomes. Patients with hematological cancer, lung cancer, or with metastatic cancer (stage IV) had the highest frequency of severe events. Non-metastatic cancer patients experienced similar frequencies of severe conditions to those observed in patients without cancer. Patients who received surgery had higher risks of having severe events, while patients with only radiotherapy did not demonstrate significant differences in severe events when compared to patients without cancer. These findings indicate that cancer patients appear more vulnerable to SARS-COV-2 outbreak.","Cancer Discov","Dai, Mengyuan","Liu, Dianbo","Liu, Miao","Zhou, Fuxiang","Li, Guiling","Chen, Zhen","Zhang, Zhian","You, Hua","Wu, Meng","Zheng, Qichao","Xiong, Yong","Xiong, Huihua","Wang, Chun","Chen, Changchun","Xiong, Fei","Zhang, Yan","Peng, Yaqin","Ge, Siping","Zhen, Bo","Yu, Tingting","Wang, Ling","Wang, Hua","Liu, Yu","Chen, Yeshan","Mei, Junhua","Gao, Xiaojia","Li, Zhuyan","Gan, Lijuan","He, Can","Li, Zhen","Shi, Yuying","Qi, Yuwen","Yang, Jing","Tenen, Daniel G","Chai, Li","Mucci, Lorelei A","Santillana, Mauricio","Cai, Hongbing","32345594"],"abstract":["The novel COVID-19 outbreak has affected more than 200 countries and territories as of March 2020. Given that patients with cancer are generally more vulnerable to infections, systematic analysis of diverse cohorts of patients with cancer affected by COVID-19 are needed. We performed a multi-center study including 105 cancer patients and 536 age-matched non-cancer patients confirmed with COVID-19. Our results showed COVID-19 patients with cancer had higher risks in all severe outcomes. Patients with hematological cancer, lung cancer, or with metastatic cancer (stage IV) had the highest frequency of severe events. Non-metastatic cancer patients experienced similar frequencies of severe conditions to those observed in patients without cancer. Patients who received surgery had higher risks of having severe events, while patients with only radiotherapy did not demonstrate significant differences in severe events when compared to patients without cancer.
