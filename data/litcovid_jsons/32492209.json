We sought to determine the clinical characteristics relevant to the clinical course of COVID-19 by comparing the family cluster to unrelated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection so that the presence of potential determinants of disease severity, other than traditional risk factors previously reported, could be investigated. METHODS: 29 patient files were investigated in Group 1 and Group 2 was created with 52 consecutive COVID-19 patients with age and gender compatibility. The virus was detected for diagnosis. The clinical, laboratory and imaging features of all patients were retrospectively screened. Disease course was assessed using records regarding outcome from patient files retrospectively. Groups were compared with respect to baseline characteristics, disease severity on presentation, disease course. RESULTS: There was no difference between the two groups in terms of comorbidity and smoking history. In terms of in-hospital treatment, use differed not significantly between two groups. We found that all 29 patients in Group 1 had severe pneumonia, 18 patients had severe pneumonia. Hospitalization rates, length of hospital stay and transferred to ICU were found to be statistically significantly higher in Group 1. CONCLUSION: In the present study, COVID-19 cases in the large family cluster were shown to have more severe disease and worse clinical course compared to consecutive COVID-19 patients presenting to the same time. We believe further studies into potential genetic mechanisms of host susceptibility to COVID-19 should include such family clusters. This article is protected by copyright.

Clinical data were collected and the general information, clinical symptoms, blood test and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. According to the relevant diagnostic criteria, the patients were divided into three groups: mild (15 cases), severe (9 cases) and critical (5 cases). The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers in the serum of each group were detected, and the changes of these indicators of the three groups were compared and analyzed, as well as their relationship with the clinical classification of the disease. Results: (1) The main symptoms of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was fever (28/29) with or without respiratory and other systemic symptoms. Two patients died with underlying disease and co-bacterial infection, respectively. (2) The blood test of the patients showed normal or decreased white blood cell count (23/29), decreased lymphocyte count (20/29), increased hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) (27/29), and normal procalcitonin.

OBJECTIVES: We compared the clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, CT images and treatment of COVID-19 patients from three different cities in China.

Compared with severe and critical groups, there were more patients taking ACEI/ARB in moderate group. More patients had multiple lung lobe involvement and pleural effusion in the critical group as compared to moderate group. Compared with the moderate group, more patients received antiviral agents within first 4 days than in severe group, and more patients received antibiotics and corticosteriods in critical and severe groups.
