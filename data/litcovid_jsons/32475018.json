OBJECTIVES: The investigation was aimed at the social and economic impact caused by this COVID-19 pandemic and the state's decision to suspend the operation of businesses and stores in Greece. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifth-eight aesthetic centers from various areas of Greece were participated in this study, and the questionnaires were sent electronically to the business owners. Statistical analyzes were conducted using Google Forms and the questionnaires analyzed through PSPP software. RESULTS: Based on their answers and the statistical analyzes, it was calculated the reduction of the monthly income for the first month of suspension of the operation of their companies. Additionally, social related matters were examined as, how they experience this period, psychologically, financially, what problems they believe that they will face and what changes in their work that could result from the pandemic. DISCUSSION: There is no similar study and experience for aesthetic centers from a viral pandemic in literature. The suspension of operations provoked serious financial problems and significant psychological burden about what \"tomorrow will bring\" with returning to \"normalcy\".","J Cosmet Dermatol","Biskanaki, Foteini","Rallis, Epsilonfstathios","Andreou, Epsilonleni","Sfiri, Epsilonleni","Tertipi, Nuiki","Kefala, Vasiliki","32475018"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Epidemics are a major cause of health problems in developing countries, preventing the accumulation of human capital and economic growth.

The new disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and by May 10, 2020, it has affected more than 4 million people worldwide and caused more than 270,000 deaths. METHODS: We describe the Greek experience regarding the response to COVID-19, with particular focus on 2 COVID-19 reference hospitals in the metropolitan area of Athens, the capital of Greece. RESULTS: The first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Greece was reported on February 26, 2020, and prompted a decisive response from the Greek government. The primary focus was containment of virus spread, considering shortage of ICU beds. A general lockdown was implemented early on, and the national Health Care System underwent massive re-structuring. Our 2 gastrointestinal (GI) centers, which provide care for more than 1500 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, are located in hospitals that were transformed to COVID-19 reference centers. To maintain sufficient care for our patients, while also contributing to the fight against COVID-19, we undertook specific measures. These included provision of telemedicine services, electronic prescriptions and home delivery of medications, isolation of infusion units and IBD clinics in COVID-free zones of the hospitals, in addition to limiting endoscopies to emergencies only.
