Virtual management \"telemedicine\" has been shown to reduce health costs and improve access to care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey is to report the views of oncologists on virtual management (VM) \"awareness, challenges, preferences\" and priority of prescribing anti-cancer treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We created self-administrated electronic survey about VM of cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated the clinical sensibility and pilot tested the instrument. We surveyed practicing oncologists using snowball sampling in the Gulf and Arab countries via emails, social media networks and sent reminders one and two weeks later using SurveyMonkey. RESULTS: We received 222 responses from validated respondents from April 2-April 22, 2020. Awareness of the virtual clinics, virtual multidisciplinary teams (MDT) and virtual prescriptions encountered in 82%, 79% and 75%, respectively. VM challenges were lack of physical exam in 60%, patient's awareness & access in 59%, lack of physical attendance of patients in 42%, IT support in 37% and safety of VM in 35%. 50% and 48% of oncologists did not prefer virtual prescription of chemotherapy and novel immunotherapy respectively, however, 85%, 74% and 57% preferred virtual prescription of hormonal, bone modifying agents and targeted therapy respectively Oncologists preferred to continue neoadjuvant, adjuvant & perioperative treatments in 83%, 83%, 80% respectively. 53% preferred to continue 1st line palliative treatment, in contrast to 20% and 30% preferred to interrupt 2nd and 3rd line palliative treatment respectively. All responders preferred oral route and 53% preferred subcutaneous (SC) route. In contrast, 87% did not prefer intravenous (IV) route. Forty six percent of oncologists responded \"definitely\" prefer to manage cancer patients virtually. CONCLUSIONS: Oncologists have high level of awareness about VM. While 2nd and 3rd line palliative treatments should be interrupted, treatments in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, peri-operative and 1st line palliative should continue.

Under the auspices of the Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists, we conducted an online national survey to better understand the impact of the pandemic on the medical oncology community in Canada. Methods: An English-language multiple-choice survey, including questions about demographics, covid-19 risk, use of personal protective equipment (ppe), personal challenges, and chemotherapy management was distributed to Canadian medical oncologists. The survey was open from 30 March to 4 April 2020, and attracted 159 responses. Results: More than 70% of medical oncologists expressed moderate-to-extreme concern about personally contracting covid-19 and about family members or patients (or both) contracting covid-19 from them. Despite that high level of concern, considerable variability in the use of ppe in direct cancer care was reported at the time of this survey, with 33% of respondents indicating no routine ppe use at their institutions and 69% indicating uncertainty about access to adequate ppe. Of the respondents, 54% were experiencing feelings of nervousness or anxiety on most days, and 52% were having feelings of depression or hopelessness on at least some days. Concern about aging parents or family and individual wellness represented the top personal challenges identified. The management of cancer patients has been affected, with adoption of telemedicine reported by 82% of respondents, and cessation of clinical trial accrual reported by 54%. The 3 factors deemed most important for treatment decision-making were cancer prognosis and anticipated benefit from treatment, risk of treatment toxicity during scarce health care access, and patient risk of contracting covid-19.

Social distancing measures were introduced in the UK in March 2020 and virtual consultations (via telephone or video call) were identified as a potential alternative to face-to-face consultations at this time. LOCAL PROBLEM: The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH) sees on average 11 200 face-to-face consultations a month. On average 7% of these are delivered virtually via telephone. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the RNOH set a target of reducing face-to-face consultations to 20% of all outpatient attendances. This report outlines a quality improvement initiative to rapidly implement virtual consultations at the RNOH. METHODS: The COVID-19 Action Team, a multidisciplinary group of healthcare professionals, was assembled to support the implementation of virtual clinics. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement approach to quality improvement was followed using the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle. A process of enablement, process redesign, delivery support and evaluation were carried out, underpinned by Improvement principles.
