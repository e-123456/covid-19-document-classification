METHODS: We included 54 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean interval between the initial and follow-up CT scans was 7.82+/-3.74 days. Patients were divided into progression and recovery groups according to their outcomes. We evaluated CT images in terms of distribution of lesions and imaging manifestations. The manifestations included ground-glass opacity (GGO), crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, irregular line, and air bronchogram sign. RESULTS: COVID-19 lesions showed mainly subpleural distribution, which was accompanied by bronchovascular bundle distribution in nearly 30% of the patients. The lower lobes of both lungs were the most commonly involved. In the follow-up, the progression group showed more involvement of the upper lobe of the left lung than the recovery group. GGO was the most common sign. As the disease progressed, round GGO decreased and patchy GGO increased. On follow-up CT, consolidation increased in the progression group while decreasing in the recovery group. Air bronchogram sign was more commonly observed at the initial examination (90.9%) than at follow-up (30%) in the recovery group, but there was no significant change in the progression group. Pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were absent in the initial examination, but pleural effusion was observed in three cases after follow-up.

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from the PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and WHO databases for studies mentioning the chest CT imaging findings of adult COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: A total of 45 studies comprising 4410 patients were included. Ground glass opacities (GGO), in isolation (50.2%) or coexisting with consolidations (44.2%), were the most common lesions. Distribution of GGOs was most commonly bilateral, peripheral/subpleural, and posterior with predilection for lower lobes. Common ancillary findings included pulmonary vascular enlargement (64%), intralobular septal thickening (60%), adjacent pleural thickening (41.7%), air bronchograms (41.2%), subpleural lines, crazy paving, bronchus distortion, bronchiectasis, and interlobular septal thickening. CT in early follow-up period generally showed an increase in size, number, and density of GGOs, with progression into mixed areas of GGOs plus consolidations and crazy paving, peaking at 10-11 days, before gradually resolving or persisting as patchy fibrosis. While younger adults more commonly had GGOs, extensive/multilobar involvement with consolidations was prevalent in the older population and those with severe disease. CONCLUSION: This review describes the imaging features for diagnosis, stratification, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients.
