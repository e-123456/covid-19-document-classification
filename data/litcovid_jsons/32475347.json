Determination of HCQ for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can be performed in whole blood (WB), serum, and plasma. Direct comparisons of WB, serum, and plasma levels of HCQ in patients with SLE have not previously been reported. We describe a method for the determination of HCQ in human blood using liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and compare the suitability of the three sample matrices. METHODS: A method for the determination of HCQ in human blood using LC-HRMS was developed, validated, and applied for the determination of HCQ levels in WB, serum, and plasma from 26 SLE patients. The reproducibility of the method, in the three matrices, was evaluated using quality control samples and repeated preparations and measurements of patient samples. The performance of the developed method for HCQ measurement in serum was further evaluated by comparison with two previously reported extraction methods. RESULTS: The performance of the presented method demonstrated high accuracy and precision. A large range of HCQ concentrations was observed for the SLE patients in all three matrices (WB, serum, and plasma). The mean levels in WB were approximately two-fold the levels in serum and plasma (813 ng/mL compared to 436 ng/mL and 362 ng/mL, respectively). Spiked quality controls showed high reproducibility for all matrices (coefficient of variation, CV, approx. 5%), whereas in patient samples, equally high-precision was only found using WB as the matrix (CV 3%). The CV for serum and plasma was 14% and 39%, respectively. Two alternative methods applied to serum samples did not demonstrate improved precision. CONCLUSIONS: A LC-HRMS method for the measurement of HCQ in human blood was developed and validated. Whole blood was found to be the superior sample matrix in terms of sample reproducibility. Thus, whole blood samples should be used for HCQ analysis when patients are monitored for HCQ treatment effects. The assay is in clinical use to monitor levels of HCQ in patients.","Arthritis Res Ther","Carlsson, Henrik","Hjorton, Karin","Abujrais, Sandy","Ronnblom, Lars","Akerfeldt, Torbjorn","Kultima, Kim","32475347"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is the standard of care in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and other inflammatory rheumatic diseases and potentially for the treatment in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: We collected clinical blood samples from voriconazole-treated patients in heparinized tubes and sterilized the surface of the tubes with 75% ethanol. The whole blood samples were centrifuged to separate the plasma with or without prior heat inactivation, or only the separated plasma was heat inactivated. Heat inactivation of the samples was carried out at 56 for 30 min followed by protein precipitation with acetonitrile or ethanol. The plasma standard and quality control samples were inactivated in an identical manner and tested with LC-MS/MS along with the treated samples. RESULTS: The optimized method showed a high imprecision (with mean intra- and inter-day imprecisions of 3.59% and 2.81%, respectively) and a high accuracy (mean 97.37%) for detecting voriconazole in the inactivated samples at different concentration levels. Sample preparation with acetonitrile or ethanol resulted in a high mean recovery (100.56% or 95.90%) with minimal mean matrix effect (102.85% or 93.62%). The measured voriconazole concentrations in inactivated whole blood, inactivated plasma and the samples without inactivation all showed good linear correlations with correlation coefficients all greater than 0.99. CONCLUSIONS: Heat inactivation at 56 for 30 min combined with ethanol sample preparation only has limited effects to affect LC-MS-based voriconazole concentration measurement in whole blood samples collected in heparinized tubes, and can be used for therapeutic drug monitoring of voriconazole during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao","Zhao, Boxin","Liu, Sijia","Liu, Yuan","Li, Guofeng","Zhang, Qing","32376593"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of heat inactivation (56for 30 min) of SARS-CoV-2 on the results of therapeuticdrug monitoring (TDM) of voriconazole by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
