Data on design, sample size, neurologic assessment and related work-up were extracted. Biases were assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS: We analysed 27 publications on potential neuroinvasive or parainfectious neurological complications of COVID-19. The reports focused on smell and taste (n=5) and evaluation of neurological symptoms and signs in cohorts (n=5). There were cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome/Miller-Fisher syndrome/cranial neuropathy (7 cases), meningitis/encephalitis (9 cases) and various other conditions (5 cases).
