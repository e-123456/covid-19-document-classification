Several clinical studies have shown very good effects of TCZ in patients with COVID-19, with a few minor side effects reported. Only eight serious liver injuries caused by TCZ were reported before being used in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Considering the significantly increased use of TCZ for the treatment of COVID-19, we would like to warn of its rare but possible serious hepatotoxicity, especially when used together with other hepatotoxic drugs. METHODS: We describe a patient with COVID-19-induced cytokine storm who developed drug-induced liver injury associated with the use of TCZ. RESULTS: One day after TCZ administration, serum transaminase levels increased 40-fold. Nevertheless, TCZ had a positive effect on clinical and laboratory parameters in cytokine storm, with transaminases values normalizing in 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of DILI caused by TCZ in a COVID-19 patient. Intensive liver function monitoring is imperative in COVID-19 patients, because of frequent polypharmacy with potentially hepatotoxic drugs.","Liver Int","Muhovic, Damir","Bojovic, Jelena","Bulatovic, Ana","Vukcevic, Batric","Ratkovic, Marina","Lazovic, Ranko","Smolovic, Brigita","32478465"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tocilizumab (TCZ; interleukine-6 receptor antagonist) has been proposed to treat severe forms of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) because interleukine-6 plays an important role in COVID-19-induced cytokine storm.
