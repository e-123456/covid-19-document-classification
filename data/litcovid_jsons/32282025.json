It assessed the difference in performance between (i) attending one instructor-led training session in donning and doffing PPE one month prior to assessment, and (ii) watching training videos over the month. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial pilot study divided 21 medical students and junior doctors into 2 groups. Control group participants attended one instructor-led training session. Video group participants watched training videos demonstrating the same procedures, which they could freely watch again at home. After one month, a doctor performed a blind evaluation of performance using checklists. RESULTS: 19 participants were assessed after one month. The mean donning score was 84.8/100 for the instructor-led group and 88/100 for the video group; mean effect size 3,2 (95%CI: -7,5 to 9,5). The mean doffing score was 79.1/100 for the instructor group and 73.9/100 for the video group; mean effect size 5,2 (95%CI: -7,6 to 18). CONCLUSION: Our study found no significant difference in donning and doffing score between instructor-led and video lessons. Video training could be a fast and resource-efficient method of training in PPE donning and doffing in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Disaster Med Public Health Prep","Christensen, Liva","Rasmussen, Charlotte Schang","Benfield, Thomas","Franc, Jeffrey Michael","32223776"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: This study compared live instructor-led training in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) donning and doffing with video-based instruction.
