OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine how Internet use, risk awareness, and demographic characteristics are associated with engagement in preventative behaviors and testing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk from April 10, 2020 to April 14, 2020.

RESULTS: Our data included 979 valid responses from the U.S. Participants who received more COVID-19-related health information online reported more frequent effort to engage in all types of preventive behaviors: wearing a facemask in public (odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95% CI 1.34-1.79P < .001), washing hands (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.35-1.85, P < .001), covering nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.52-2.10, P < .001), keeping social distance with others (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.21-1.65, P < .001), staying home (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.20-1.62, P < .001), avoiding using public transportation (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32-1.88, P < .001), and cleaning frequently used surfaces (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.34-1.79, P < .001).
