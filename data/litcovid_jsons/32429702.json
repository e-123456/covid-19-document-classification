This may provide increased access to diabetes health care in certain settings. However, health care disparities continue to challenge availability of diabetes technologies for underprivileged communities. We report our experience with two patients providing diabetes care effectively and preventing hospital admissions by using telehealth. Methods: Two adult patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D): one new onset and the other one with established T1D are presented where telehealth facilitated by Clarity Software and the \"Share\" feature with the use of Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for management of diabetic ketosis and hyperglycemia. Results: Both patients were managed effectively virtually despite higher risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Shared glucose data through CGM facilitated frequent insulin dose adjustments, increased fluid and carbohydrate intake, and prevented hospital admissions in both cases. In the case of new onset patient with T1D, most of the education was done remotely by certified diabetes care and education specialists. Conclusion: Acute diabetes complication like DKA increases morbidity and mortality in addition to adding cost to the health care system. The current pandemic of COVID-19 has allowed newer ways (with the help of newer technologies) to manage high-risk patients with T1D and DKA through telehealth and may result in lasting benefits to people with T1D.","Diabetes Technol Ther","Peters, Anne L","Garg, Satish","32383989"],"abstract":["Background: The Stay at Home order in Colorado and The Stay Safe at Home order in California during COVID-19 pandemic have forced a majority of the endocrinologists/diabetologists to adapt to providing diabetes care remotely through telehealth.
