A pandemic at the large-scale like COVID-19 places extraordinary demands on the world's health systems, dramatically devastates vulnerable populations, and critically threatens the global communities in an unprecedented way. While tremendous efforts at the frontline are placed on detecting the virus, providing treatments and developing vaccines, it is also critically important to examine the technologies and systems for tackling disease emergence, arresting its spread and especially the strategy for diseases prevention.

The Korean government entrusted large scale hospitals to operate living and treatment support centers for the management for clinically healthy COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: We adopted new electronic health record templates, hospital information system dashboards, cloud based medical image sharing, mobile application, and smart vital sign monitoring devices. RESULTS: Enhancements were made to the hospital information system to assist in the workflow and care of patients in the living and treatment support center. A dashboard was created for the medical staff to view the vital signs and symptoms of all patients. Patients used a mobile application to consult with their physician or nurse, answer questionnaires, and input self-measured vital signs; the results were uploaded to the hospital information system in real-time.
