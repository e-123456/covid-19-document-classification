This study provides a brief and precise review of the current knowledge regarding COVID-19, including disease transmission, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and potential treatment. The article focused on COVID-19-related information useful in otolaryngologist practice. METHODS: The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using terms \"COVID-19\", \"SARS-CoV-2\" in conjunction with \"otorhinolaryngological manifestation\", \"ENT\", and \"olfaction\". RESULTS: The most common otolaryngological dysfunctions of COVID-19 were cough, sore throat, and dyspnea. Rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dizziness were also present. COVID-19 could manifest as an isolated sudden hyposmia/anosmia. Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger patients and usually appeared initially. They could be present even before the molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Otolaryngologists are of great risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as they cope with URT. ENT surgeons could be easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 during performing surgery in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Ear, nose and throat (ENT) symptoms may precede the development of severe COVID-19.

While elective activity has halted across the board nationally, the slow plateau of COVID-19 case rates prompts the question of timing of resumption of clinical activity. We sought to prospectively predict geographical \"hot zones\" for otolaryngological exposure to COVID-19 based on procedural volumes data from 2013 to 2017. METHODS: Otolaryngologic CPT codes were stratified based on risk-level, according to recently published specialty-specific guidelines. Using the Medicare POSPUF database, aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) were mapped based on hospital referral regions, against up-to-date COVID-19 case distribution data, as of April 24, 2020. RESULTS: The most common AGPs were diagnostic flexible laryngoscopy, diagnostic nasal endoscopy, and flexible laryngoscopy with stroboscopy. The regions with the most AGPs per otolaryngologist were Iowa City, IA, Detroit, MI, and Burlington, VT, while the states with the most COVID-19 cases as of April 24th are New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a model for predicting possible \"hot zones\" for otolaryngologic exposure based on both COVID-19 case density and AGP-density.
