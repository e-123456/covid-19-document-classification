COVID-19 emerged as a viral cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome that spread all over the world in the last months.

METHODS: report a case of a co-infection of COVID-19 with VZV, and review the literature. RESULTS: 39-year-old immunocompetent man with oligosymptomatic infection by COVID-19 evolved to left facial herpes zoster affecting the three divisions of trigeminal nerve. The co-infection was remotely registered with other respiratory virus, being influenza the most mentioned. However, the present case is associated to the emergence of a latent virus infection, which might be related to the viral inflammatory response, especially ascending from the nasal cavity, where trigeminal branches are also placed.
