In addition, only ritonavir could interact with the oxyanion hole residues N142 and G143 via the formation of two hydrogen bonds. The interactions in terms of electrostatics, dispersion, and charge transfer played an important role in the drug binding. The obtained results demonstrated how repurposed anti-HIV drugs could be used to combat COVID-19."],"journal":"Biochemistry","authors":["Nutho, Bodee","Mahalapbutr, Panupong","Hengphasatporn, Kowit","Pattaranggoon, Nawanwat Chainuwong","Simanon, Nattapon","Shigeta, Yasuteru","Hannongbua, Supot","Rungrotmongkol, Thanyada"],"date":"2020-04-16T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32293875","source":"PubMed","week":"202016|Apr 13 - Apr 19","doi":"10.1021/acs.biochem.0c00160","locations":["Wuhan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"e_drugs":["Ritonavir","Lopinavir","4-(3-benzyl-4-(5-(2-fluorophenyl)-ruan-2-ylmethylene)-5-oxo-4,5-dihydropyrazol-1-yl)benzoic acid","Water"],"topics":["Treatment","Mechanism"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138494353801221,"score":212.1375}]}
