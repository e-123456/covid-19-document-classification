We assessed the compliance of health workers with infection prevention and control practices relevant to COVID-19 in outpatient settings in Tanzania, before the pandemic. METHODS: This study was based on a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data collected as part of a randomised controlled trial in private for-profit dispensaries and health centres and in faith-based dispensaries, health centres, and hospitals, in 18 regions. We observed provider-patient interactions in outpatient consultation rooms, laboratories, and dressing rooms, and categorised infection prevention and control practices into four domains: hand hygiene, glove use, disinfection of reusable equipment, and waste management. We calculated compliance as the proportion of indications (infection risks) in which a health worker performed a correct action, and examined associations between compliance and health worker and facility characteristics using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models. FINDINGS: Between Feb 7 and April 5, 2018, we visited 228 health facilities, and observed at least one infection prevention and control indication in 220 facilities (118 [54%] dispensaries, 66 [30%] health centres, and 36 [16%] hospitals). 18 710 indications were observed across 734 health workers (49 [7%] medical doctors, 214 [29%] assistant medical officers or clinical officers, 106 [14%] nurses or midwives, 126 [17%] clinical assistants, and 238 [32%] laboratory technicians or assistants). Compliance was 6.9% for hand hygiene (n=8655 indications), 74.8% for glove use (n=4915), 4.8% for disinfection of reusable equipment (n=841), and 43.3% for waste management (n=4299). Facility location was not associated with compliance in any of the infection prevention and control domains. Facility level and ownership were also not significantly associated with compliance, except for waste management. For hand hygiene, nurses and midwives (odds ratio 5.80 [95% CI 3.91-8.61]) and nursing and medical assistants (2.65 [1.67-4.20]) significantly outperformed the reference category of assistant medical officers or clinical officers. For glove use, nurses and midwives (10.06 [6.68-15.13]) and nursing and medical assistants (5.93 [4.05-8.71]) also significantly outperformed the reference category. Laboratory technicians performed significantly better in glove use (11.95 [8.98-15.89]), but significantly worse in hand hygiene (0.27 [0.17-0.43]) and waste management (0.25 [0.14-0.44] than the reference category. Health worker age was negatively associated with correct glove use and female health workers were more likely to comply with hand hygiene. INTERPRETATION: Health worker infection prevention and control compliance, particularly for hand hygiene and disinfection, was inadequate in these outpatient settings.

Diversion of healthcare resources for containing the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly undermined the accessibility and availability of essential health services. Under these circumstances, the preparedness of PHCs in providing safe patient-centered care for meeting the current health needs of the population and prevent further transmission of the SARS-CoV2 infection is crucial. OBJECTIVE: To determine the primary healthcare (PHC) facility preparedness towards the provision of safe outpatient services during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among supervisors and managers of primary healthcare facilities attached to medical colleges and institutions in India. A list of 60 faculty involved in the management and supervision of PHCs affiliated to the community medicine departments of medical colleges and institutes across India was compiled from an accessible private organization member database. We collected the data through a rapid survey from April 24-April 30 2020 using a google-forms online digital questionnaire that evaluated preparedness parameters based on self-assessment by the participants. The preparedness domains assessed were infrastructure availability, health worker safety, and patient care. RESULTS: A total of 51 faculty responded to the survey. Each medical college/institution was having on average (SD) a total of 2.94 (1.7) PHCs under its jurisdiction. Infrastructural and infection control deficits at the PHC were reported in terms of limited physical space and queuing capacity, lack of separate entry and exit gates (49%), suboptimal ventilation (57%), and negligible airborne infection control measures (75.5%). N-95 masks were available at 26 (50.9%) sites. Infection prevention and control measures were also suboptimal with inadequate facilities for handwashing and hand hygiene reported in 23.5% and 27.4% sites, respectively. The operation of outpatient services, particularly related to maternal and child health, were significantly disrupted (p < 0.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Existing PHC facilities in India providing outpatient services are constrained in their functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic due to weak infrastructure contributing to suboptimal patient safety and infection control measures. Furthermore, there is a need for effective planning, communication, and coordination between the centralized health policymakers and health managers working at primary healthcare facilities to ensure overall preparedness during public health emergencies.

RESULTS: This study included a total of 368 dentists aged 22-73 years (mean 32.9 years, SD 10.6 years).
