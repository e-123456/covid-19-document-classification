This pandemic has managed to overwhelm the health care system of the most advanced countries in the world. As the whole of the medical fraternity stands robed as health care professionals to fight against COVID-19, specialty emergencies like trauma continue to pester the already overburdened health care community. This situation calls for the need for a pandemic response protocol (PREP) in each specialty that helps the doctors to manage specialty emergencies without chaos and at the same time allowing them to play their part in pandemic management. CONCLUSION: PREP as an integrated pragmatic approach is essential in containing pandemics as they need international cooperation at various levels starting from knowledge sharing to monetary support. PREP which is in line with the WHO action plan, will be an essential minimum response of a non-frontline pandemic response specialty like orthopedics to combat and curtail the effects of a pandemic in a multispecialty tertiary health care centre.","Int Orthop","Chellamuthu, Girinivasan","Muthu, Sathish","32468203"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: 3,181,642 cases and 224,301 deaths in 212 regions of the world-this is the status of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic as of May 1, 2020.
