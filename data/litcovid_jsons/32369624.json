However, there are concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic will not affect all equally and some populations will be particularly vulnerable. Relevant to liver disease, patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) may be amongst the populations that are the most severely impacted. The reasons for this include being at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection due to a depressed immune system and high-risk underlying comorbidities, the injurious effect of COVID-19 on the liver, the inability to attend regular visits with providers, diversion of hospital resources, and social isolation leading to psychological decompensation and increased drinking or relapse. As a result, we fear that there will be a dramatic rising tide of alcohol relapse, admissions for decompensated ALD, and an increase in newly diagnosed patients with AUD/ALD post-COVID-19 pandemic. Liver centers should implement pre-emptive strategies such as telehealth and aggressive patient outreach programs now to curb this anticipated problem. Liver transplant programs need to consider offering some leniency to patients with AUD/ALD who cannot obtain alcohol treatment due to the current situation. In conclusion, we expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will be especially detrimental to patients with AUD/ALD and actions need to be taken now to limit the scope of this anticipated problem.","Hepatology","Da, Ben L","Im, Gene Y","Schiano, Thomas D","32369624"],"abstract":["The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a tremendous global impact since it began in November of 2019.

Liver impairment has been frequently reported as a common manifestation, although its clinical significance is still unclear, particularly in patients with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD). AIMS: To summarize the changes in liver function tests during SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of COVID-19 in patients with underlying CLD. METHODS: A literature review using online database Pubmed was done using the search terms \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"COVID-19\", \"liver\", \"cirrhosis\" and \"liver transplantation\". RESULTS: COVID-19 is frequently associated with different degrees of abnormal liver function tests, most notably transaminases, which are usually transitory and of mild degree. Available evidence suggests that liver injury may result from direct pathogenic effect by the virus, systemic inflammation or toxicity from commonly used drugs in this subset of patients. SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is associated with minimal or no increase in liver enzymes, thus the presence of abnormal liver function tests should trigger evaluation for underlying liver diseases. Although it seems that patients with CLD are not at greater risk for acquiring the infection, those with cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune liver diseases or liver transplant may have a greater risk for severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal liver function tests during the course of COVID-19 are common, though clinically significant liver injury is rare. Further research is needed focusing on the effect of existing liver-related comorbidities on treatment and outcome of COVID-19.","Aliment Pharmacol Ther","Garrido, Isabel","Liberal, Rodrigo","Macedo, Guilherme","32402090"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), became a global threat to human health.
