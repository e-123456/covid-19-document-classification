METHODS: An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. RESULTS: Nine studies with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD -31 x 10(9)/L; 95% CI, from -35 to -29 x 10(9)/L). A subgroup analysis comparing patients by survival, found an even lower platelet count was observed with mortality (WMD, -48 x 10(9)/L; 95% CI, -57 to -39 x 10(9)/L. In the four studies (n = 1427) which reported data on rate of thrombocytopenia, a low platelet count was associated with over fivefold enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8-14.6). CONCLUSIONS: Low platelet count is associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and thus should serve as clinical indicator of worsening illness during hospitalization."],"journal":"Clin Chim Acta","authors":["Lippi, Giuseppe","Plebani, Mario","Henry, Brandon Michael"],"date":"2020-03-18T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32178975","week":"202012|Mar 16 - Mar 22","doi":"10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.022","keywords":["Coronavirus, COVID-19","Platelets","Thrombocytopenia"],"source":"PubMed","locations":["Scopus","Thrombocytopenia","Medline","thrombocytopenia"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1663095625932079105,"score":345.3334}]}
