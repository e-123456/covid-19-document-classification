METHODS: All adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study in two designated hospitals during 21 January 2020-16 March 2020 in Anhui, China. In all patients, data on the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding were analyzed by reviewing all RNA detection results during hospitalization.

Factors associated with prolonged viral shedding were analyzed with the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Among 181 patients, the mean age was 44.3+/-13.2 years, and 55.2% were male. The median duration of viral shedding from illness onset was 18.0 days (IQR 15.0-24.0). Prolonged viral shedding was associated with longer hospital stays (P<0.001) and higher medical costs (P<0.001). The severity of COVID-19 had nothing to do with prolonged shedding.

INTERPRETATION: The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 mug/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.
