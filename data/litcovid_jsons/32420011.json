Studies in subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been heterogeneous in objectives and methodology, but generally support the concept that TM interventions produce clinical benefit, cost-effectiveness and user satisfaction.

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility of planned real-time audiovisual teleconsultation over the internet in patients with MS. METHODS: Twenty subjects with MS presenting at a specialized MS center in Belgium were recruited for this study. One teleconsultation was scheduled in each participant. Patients were provided a unique hyperlink by mail in advance, leading them automatically and directly to the virtual waiting room, where they could accept or decline our incoming call. All teleconsultations were performed by a trained medical student with the intention to keep the conversation similar to what is usually discussed during a classic face-to-face MS consultation; no remote physical exams were performed. The approach was considered feasible if at least 80% of the planned TM visits could be successfully completed at the foreseen moment. Patient satisfaction (technical quality, convenience and overall quality of care) was evaluated at the end of each teleconsultation by means of 5-point Likert scales containing the categories very unsatisfied, unsatisfied, neutral, satisfied and highly satisfied. RESULTS: Seventeen out of twenty teleconsultations were successfully completed (85%). Failures were due to patients not responding (2/20) and technical issues (1/20). Rates of patients declaring themselves satisfied or highy satisfied were 17/17 for technical quality, 15/17 for convenience and 16/17 for overall quality of care.

Being highly prevalent, the correct use of these masks is particularly important, as an incorrect use and disposal may actually increase the rate of transmission. The purpose of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practices of healthcare workers (HCWs) in wearing a surgical face mask to limit the spread of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Materials and Methods This survey was conducted by interviewing HCWs using a questionnaire consisting of the basic demographic characteristics, and the knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding the use of surgical face mask to limit the new COVID-19 exposure. Each correct answer was scored 1 and each incorrect answer scored 0. The total number of questions was 16, and the final score was calculated and then labeled according to the percentage (out of 16) of correct responses as good (>80%), moderate (60-80%), and poor (<60%). Results A total of 392 participants with a mean age of 42.37 +/- 13.34 years (341 males and 51 females) were included in the study. The overall final results were good in 138 (35.2%), moderate in 178 (45.4%), and poor in 76 (19.3%).
