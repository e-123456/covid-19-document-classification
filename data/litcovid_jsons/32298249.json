The patient was initially evaluated at hospital A on February 15; at that time, COVID-19 was not suspected, as the patient denied travel or contact with symptomatic persons. During a 4-day hospitalization, the patient was managed with standard precautions and underwent multiple aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), including nebulizer treatments, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation, endotracheal intubation, and bronchoscopy. Several days after the patient's transfer to hospital B, a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 returned positive. Among 121 hospital A health care personnel (HCP) who were exposed to the patient, 43 (35.5%) developed symptoms during the 14 days after exposure and were tested for SARS-CoV-2; three had positive test results and were among the first known cases of probable occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to HCP in the United States. Little is known about specific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in health care settings. To better characterize and compare exposures among HCP who did and did not develop COVID-19, standardized interviews were conducted with 37 hospital A HCP who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, including the three who had positive test results. Performing physical examinations and exposure to the patient during nebulizer treatments were more common among HCP with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than among those without COVID-19; HCP with COVID-19 also had exposures of longer duration to the patient. Because transmission-based precautions were not in use, no HCP wore personal protective equipment (PPE) recommended for COVID-19 patient care during contact with the index patient.

Medium-risk contacts wore all U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended personal protective equipment during interactions.

In total, 35 high-risk contact NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing; all 35 pairs (100%) tested negative. CONCLUSIONS: This report demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause mild illness and result in positive tests for up to 18 days after diagnosis, without evidence of transmission to close contacts. These data might inform public health strategies to manage individuals with asymptomatic infection or mild illness."],"journal":"Clin Infect Dis","authors":["Scott, Sarah E","Zabel, Karen","Collins, Jennifer","Hobbs, Katherine C","Kretschmer, Melissa J","Lach, Mitchell","Turnbow, Katie","Speck, Lindsay","White, Jessica R","Maldonado, Keila","Howard, Brandon","Fowler, Jeanene","Singh, Sonia","Robinson, Susan","Pompa, Alexandra Peterson","Chatham-Stephens, Kevin","Xie, Amy","Cates, Jordan","Lindstrom, Stephen","Lu, Xiaoyan","Rolfes, Melissa A","Flanagan, Marcy","Sunenshine, Rebecca"],"date":"2020-04-03T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32240285","week":"202014|Mar 30 - Apr 05","doi":"10.1093/cid/ciaa374","keywords":["COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2","illness severity","serial testing","viral transmission"],"source":"PubMed","locations":["China","USA","Maricopa County","United States","Arizona"],"countries":["China","United States"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China","USA|United States"],"topics":["Case Report"],"weight":1,"_version_":1663352135503314944,"score":278.65482}]}
