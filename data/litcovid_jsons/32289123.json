This study was performed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of medical staff in two Chinese mental health centers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We included 141 psychiatrists and 170 psychiatric nurses in the study. We found that during the COVID-19 epidemic, 89.51% of the medical staff of the psychiatric hospitals studied had extensive knowledge of COVID-19, and 64.63% of them received the relevant training in hospitals. Furthermore, about 77.17% of participants expressed a willingness to care for psychiatric patients suffering from COVID-19 virus infection. Independent predictors of willingness to care for patients included advanced training and experience of caring for patients with COVID-19. In conclusion, this study suggests that increased attention should be paid to the knowledge and attitudes of medical staff at psychiatric hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Brain Behav Immun Health","Shi, Yudong","Wang, Juan","Yang, Yating","Wang, Zhiqiang","Wang, Guoqing","Hashimoto, Kenji","Zhang, Kai","Liu, Huanzhong","32289123"],"abstract":["On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus COVID-19 a pandemic.
