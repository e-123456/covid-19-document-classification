Unfortunately, the information about early prediction factors for disease progression is relatively limited. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate the risk factors of developing severe disease. The objective of the study was to reveal the risk factors of developing severe disease by comparing the differences in the hemocyte count and dynamic profiles in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. Methods In this retrospectively analyzed cohort, 141 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled in Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Taizhou Hospital, Zhejiang Province, China, from January 17, 2020 to February 26, 2020. Clinical characteristics and hemocyte counts of severe and non-severe COVID patients were collected. The differences in the hemocyte counts and dynamic profiles in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 were compared. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify potential biomarkers for predicting disease progression. A concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, decision curve and the clinical impact curve were calculated to assess the predictive accuracy. Results The data showed that the white blood cell count, neutrophil count and platelet count were normal on the day of hospital admission in most COVID-19 patients (87.9%, 85.1% and 88.7%, respectively). A total of 82.8% of severe patients had lymphopenia after the onset of symptoms, and as the disease progressed, there was marked lymphopenia. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that the neutrophil count (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.441, 95% CI = 1.954-10.090, p = 0.000), lymphocyte count (HR = 0.255, 95% CI = 0.097-0.669, p = 0.006) and platelet count (HR = 0.244, 95% CI = 0.111-0.537, p = 0.000) were independent risk factors for disease progression. The C-index (0.821 [95% CI, 0.746-0.896]), calibration curve, decision curve and the clinical impact curve showed that the nomogram can be used to predict the disease progression in COVID-19 patients accurately. In addition, the data involving the neutrophil count, lymphocyte count and platelet count (NLP score) have something to do with improving risk stratification and management of COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: A cohort of 17 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections who were admitted to the Ninth Hospital of Nanchang between January 28 and February 6, 2020, were enrolled in this study. All the patients received standardized treatment. The disease progression was evaluated every 7 days after admission. The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory characteristics were retrospectively analyzed, and the factors associated with the disease progression were screened by binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 11 women (64.7%) and 6 men (35.3%) between the ages of 18 to 70 years old. All patients had a reported history of contact with infection-confirmed patients. Fever (11/64.7%) and cough (8/47.1%) were the most common symptoms, whereas dyspnea (2/11.8%) and fatigue (3/17.6%) were rare, and there was no patient with diarrhea symptoms. There were 5 patients with aggravated disease at the first disease progression evaluation, and no patient received mechanical ventilation, transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), or progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, or death. Based on the disease progression, patients were divided into the non-aggravation group (12 cases) and the aggravation group (5 cases). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to their clinical characteristics. Chest computed tomography (CT) on admission revealed there were 8 patients (47.1%) with invasive lesions found bilaterally on the lungs on multiple lobes, 4 patients (23.5%) with invasive lesions on 1 lobe, and 5 patients (29.4%) with normal chest CT. The aggravation group had1 patient (20.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 3 (60.0%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 1 (20.0%) with normal chest CT; meanwhile, the nonaggravation group had 3 patients (25.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 5 (41.7%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 4 (33.3%) with normal chest CT. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups. In the aggravation group, the total lymphocyte counts significantly decreased in comparison to that in the non-aggravation group. Further analysis showed that the CD4+ T cell count but not the CD8+ T cell count of the aggravation group was significantly lower than that of the non-aggravation group. Correlation analysis indicated total lymphocyte count was positively correlated with CD4+ T cell count, and no significant differences were found between the 2 groups in other laboratory measurements, including those of white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. Finally, a binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with the disease progression. It was found that total lymphocyte count was a risk factor associated with disease progression in patients infected with 2019-nCoV.

Methods We retrospectively analyzed the hematological findings of 72 patients with COVID-19 admitted from January 21 to February 17, 2020. The final date of follow-up was March 20, 2020. Dynamic profile of vital hematological parameters in severe and non-severe patients was presented at different time points (day 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 after admission), and the correlation of hematological parameters with hospitalization time was indicated. Results Of 72 patients with COVID-19, lymphopenia and leukopenia occurred in 39 (54.2%) and 20 (27.8%) patients with COVID-19, respectively. Fifteen (20.8%) patients were defined as severe cases and 57 (79.2%) were non-severe cases. Compared to non-severe patients, leukocyte count, neutrophil count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were significantly higher, whereas lymphocyte count was declined in severe patients at each time point. A growing trend in platelet count was found in non-severe patients over the follow-up period. In addition, a positive correlation of NLR with hospitalization time was detected from day 5 after admission. Conclusions Dynamic changes in vital hematological parameters from severe and non-severe patients had been characterized in the course of hospitalization. During hospitalization, NLR was found to have certain relevance to the hospitalization days and a role in forecasting disease prognosis for patients with COVID-19."],"journal":"Clin Chem Lab Med","authors":["Ding, Xiurong","Yu, Yanhua","Lu, Bichao","Huo, Jianbo","Chen, Ming","Kang, Yanfang","Lou, Jinli","Liu, Zhizhong"],"date":"2020-05-23T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32441666","source":"PubMed","week":"202021|May 18 - May 24","doi":"10.1515/cclm-2020-0411","keywords":["coronavirus disease 2019","hematological parameters","hospitalization time","neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"],"locations":["neutrophil","neutrophil"],"topics":["Treatment","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1667535119529803777,"score":220.30083}]}
