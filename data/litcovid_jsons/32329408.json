Worldwide this disease has infected over 2.5 million individuals with a mortality rate ranging from 5 to 10%. There are several efforts are going on in the drug discovery to control the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. The main protease (M(Pro)) plays a critical role in viral replication and maturation, thus can serve as the primary drug target. To understand the structural evolution of M(Pro), we have performed phylogenetic and Sequence Similarity Network analysis, that depicted divergence of Coronaviridae M(Pro) in five clusters specific to viral hosts. This clustering was corroborated with the comparison of M(Pro) structures. Furthermore, it has been observed that backbone and binding site conformations are conserved despite variation in some of the residues. These attributes can be exploited to repurpose available viral protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 M(Pro). In agreement with this, we performed screening of approximately 7100 molecules including active ingredients present in the Ayurvedic anti-tussive medicines, anti-viral phytochemicals and synthetic anti-virals against SARS-CoV-2 M(Pro) as the primary target. We identified several natural molecules like delta-viniferin, myricitrin, taiwanhomoflavone A, lactucopicrin 15-oxalate, nympholide A, afzelin, biorobin, hesperidin and phyllaemblicin B that strongly binds to SARS-CoV-2 M(Pro). Intrestingly, these molecules also showed strong binding with other potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection like viral receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).
