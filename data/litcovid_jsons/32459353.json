We determined the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and characterized the symptoms of patients with mild COVID-19. METHODS: We recruited the study participants from a community facility designated for isolation of patients without moderate-to-severe symptoms of COVID-19 in South Korea. The prevalence of asymptomatic patients at admission and the detailed symptoms of mild COVID-19 were evaluated through a questionnaire-based survey. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Of the 213 patients with COVID-19, 41 (19.2%) were asymptomatic until admission. Among the remaining patients with mild COVID-19, the most common symptom was cough (40.1% [69/172]), followed by hyposmia (39.5% [68/172]) and sputum (39.5%, [68/172]). Of the 68 patients with hyposmia, 61 (90%) patients had accompanying symptoms such as hypogeusia, nasal congestion, or rhinorrhea. Fever (>37.5 degrees C) was only observed in 20 (11.6%). CONCLUSIONS: As much as one-fifth of patients with COVID-19 had remained asymptomatic from exposure to admission. Hyposmia was quite frequent among patients with mild COVID-19, whereas fever was not. Social distancing should be strongly implemented to prevent disease transmission from asymptomatic patients or those with mild and inconspicuous symptoms.","Clin Microbiol Infect","Kim, Gwang-Un","Kim, Min-Jae","Ra, Sang Hyun","Lee, Jeongsoo","Bae, Seongman","Jung, Jiwon","Kim, Sung-Han","32360780"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVES: Detailed knowledge on the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and the clinical characteristics of mild COVID-19 is essential for effective control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: A total of 511 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection cases, including 100 asymptomatic (by the time of the pathogenic tests) and 411 symptomatic individuals were consecutively enrolled from January 25 to February 20, 2020 from hospitals in 21 cities and 47 counties or districts in Sichuan Province. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics were compared. RESULTS: Compared to the symptomatic patients, the asymptomatic cases were younger (P<0.001), had similar co-morbidity percentages (P=0.609), and came from higher altitude areas with lower population mobility (P<0.001) with better defined epidemiological history (P<0.001). 27.4% of well-documented asymptomatic cases developed delayed symptoms after the pathogenic diagnosis. 60% of asymptomatic cases demonstrated findings of pneumonia on the initial chest CT, including well-recognized features of coronavirus disease-19.
