Nevertheless, genetic factors in different ethnic groups often contribute to disease severity and treatment response. In particular, the frequency of genetic variations in the androgen receptor differs by ethnicity and gender. For example, the increased prevalence of prostate cancer and androgenetic alopecia among African Americans correlates with the frequency of these variants. In this communication, we propose that androgens may be implicated in COVID-19 disease severity. As such, special attention may need to be given to African Americans infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
