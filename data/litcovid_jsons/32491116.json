Twenty-five patients (23.1%, 25/108) developed severe disease, and of those 12 (48%, 12/25) patients died. Advanced age, co-morbidities with hypertension, higher blood leukocyte count, neutrophil count, higher sensitive C-reactive protein level, D-dimer level, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APECHE ) score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were associated with greater risk of development of severe COVID-19, and so were lower lymphocyte count and albumin level.
