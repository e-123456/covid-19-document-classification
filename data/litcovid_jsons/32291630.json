It assessed the difference in performance between (i) attending one instructor-led training session in donning and doffing PPE one month prior to assessment, and (ii) watching training videos over the month. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial pilot study divided 21 medical students and junior doctors into 2 groups. Control group participants attended one instructor-led training session. Video group participants watched training videos demonstrating the same procedures, which they could freely watch again at home. After one month, a doctor performed a blind evaluation of performance using checklists. RESULTS: 19 participants were assessed after one month. The mean donning score was 84.8/100 for the instructor-led group and 88/100 for the video group; mean effect size 3,2 (95%CI: -7,5 to 9,5). The mean doffing score was 79.1/100 for the instructor group and 73.9/100 for the video group; mean effect size 5,2 (95%CI: -7,6 to 18). CONCLUSION: Our study found no significant difference in donning and doffing score between instructor-led and video lessons. Video training could be a fast and resource-efficient method of training in PPE donning and doffing in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Disaster Med Public Health Prep","Christensen, Liva","Rasmussen, Charlotte Schang","Benfield, Thomas","Franc, Jeffrey Michael","32223776"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: This study compared live instructor-led training in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) donning and doffing with video-based instruction.

COVID-19 is predominantly caused by contact or droplet transmission attributed to relatively large respiratory particles which are subject to gravitational forces and travel only approximately one metre from the patient. Airborne transmission may occur if patient respiratory activity or medical procedures generate respiratory aerosols. These aerosols contain particles that may travel much longer distances and remain airborne longer, but their infective potential is uncertain.

Personal protective equipment is an important component, but only one part, of a system protecting staff and other patients from COVID-19 cross-infection. Appropriate use significantly reduces risk of viral transmission. Personal protective equipment should logically be matched to the potential mode of viral transmission occurring during patient care - contact, droplet, or airborne. Recommendations from international organisations are broadly consistent, but equipment use is not. Only airborne precautions include a fitted high-filtration mask, and this should be reserved for aerosol-generating procedures.
