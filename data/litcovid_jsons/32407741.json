Aims: to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Gastroenterology Divisions across Italy. Methods: All members of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology (SIGE) were invited to answer a web-based survey. Results: Data of 121 hospitals from all 20 Italian regions were analyzed. Overall, 10.7% Gastroenterology Divisions have been converted to Covid Units. Outpatients consultations, endoscopic and ultrasound procedures were limited to urgencies and oncology indications in 85.1%, 96.2% and 72.2% of Units, respectively, and 46.7% of them suspended the screening for colorectal cancer.Moreover, 72.2% of the staff received a training for use of personal protective equipment, although 45.5% did not have sufficient devices for adequate replacement. Overall, 132 healthcare workers in 41 Gastroenterology Divisions were found to be infected. Conclusion: This is the first study to evaluate, at a country level, the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on Gastroenterology Divisions. Substantial changes of practice and reduction of procedures have been recorded in the entire country. The long-term impact of such modifications is difficult to estimate but potentially very risky for many digestive diseases.","Dig Liver Dis","Maida, M","Sferrazza, S","Savarino, E","Ricciardiello, L","Repici, A","Morisco, F","Furnari, M","Fuccio, L","Morreale, G C","Vitello, A","Burra, P","Marchi, S","Annibale, B","Benedetti, A","Alvaro, D","Ianiro, G","32425733"],"abstract":["Background: In Italy, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed the entire healthcare system and required a huge re-organization of many Divisions, including those of Gastroenterology.
