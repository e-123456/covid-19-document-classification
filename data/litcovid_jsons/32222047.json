Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan. Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough. Metagenomic RNA sequencing(4) of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here 'WH-Human 1' coronavirus (and has also been referred to as '2019-nCoV'). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China(5). This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.","Nature","Wu, Fan","Zhao, Su","Yu, Bin","Chen, Yan-Mei","Wang, Wen","Song, Zhi-Gang","Hu, Yi","Tao, Zhao-Wu","Tian, Jun-Hua","Pei, Yuan-Yuan","Yuan, Ming-Li","Zhang, Yu-Ling","Dai, Fa-Hui","Liu, Yi","Wang, Qi-Min","Zheng, Jiao-Jiao","Xu, Lin","Holmes, Edward C","Zhang, Yong-Zhen","32015508"],"abstract":["Emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Zika virus disease, present a major threat to public health(1-3).
