Limited access to specialized care facilities and expanding patient populations are currently, combined with unprecedented mobility restrictions imposed by the 'coronavirus disease of 2019' pandemic, stressing the need for remote solutions in this field. Studies in subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been heterogeneous in objectives and methodology, but generally support the concept that TM interventions produce clinical benefit, cost-effectiveness and user satisfaction. Nonetheless, data on live interaction between patients and health-care providers for MS teleconsultation purposes remain scarce. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility of planned real-time audiovisual teleconsultation over the internet in patients with MS. METHODS: Twenty subjects with MS presenting at a specialized MS center in Belgium were recruited for this study. One teleconsultation was scheduled in each participant. Patients were provided a unique hyperlink by mail in advance, leading them automatically and directly to the virtual waiting room, where they could accept or decline our incoming call. All teleconsultations were performed by a trained medical student with the intention to keep the conversation similar to what is usually discussed during a classic face-to-face MS consultation; no remote physical exams were performed. The approach was considered feasible if at least 80% of the planned TM visits could be successfully completed at the foreseen moment. Patient satisfaction (technical quality, convenience and overall quality of care) was evaluated at the end of each teleconsultation by means of 5-point Likert scales containing the categories very unsatisfied, unsatisfied, neutral, satisfied and highly satisfied. RESULTS: Seventeen out of twenty teleconsultations were successfully completed (85%). Failures were due to patients not responding (2/20) and technical issues (1/20).

As residents rely upon operative exposure and in-person didactic lectures for education, the disruptions caused by the pandemic have forced programs to revise how they educate residents. Here we surveyed program directors (PDs) to ascertain how they have altered the education and clinical care responsibilities of residents in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Surveys were sent to the PDs of all ACGME-accredited neurosurgery programs. Survey questions targeted changes in resident staffing and coverage, changes in didactic material delivery, and changes in resident wellness initiatives. PD concerns were also elicited. RESULTS: Of the 116 program PDs invited, 57 responded (49.1%). We found that most programs have reduced resident work weeks (65%) and in-hospital resident shift census (95%). Few have redeployed residents and most are increasingly relying on teleconferencing solutions for meetings and resident education. Most commonly programs are using faculty- (91%) or resident-led (65%) lectures, though nearly 75% are supplementing resident education with materials from the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS). Continuing education in spite of decreased case volume and maintaining resident morale are cited as the most common concerns of PDs. CONCLUSION: Here we find that there is great homogeneity in the responses of neurosurgical residency programs to the COVID-19 pandemic.
