The mortality rate was 4.0% (40 cases). The median age of nonsurvivors (68 years) was significantly older than survivors (62 years).

Thus, the aim of this study was to establish a nomogram to detect COVID-19. Methods: A nomogram was established using data collected from 457 patients (181 with COVID-19 and 276 with influenza A or B infection) in China. The nomogram used age, lymphocyte percentage, and monocyte count to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. Results: Our nomogram predicted probabilities of COVID-19 with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.913 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.883-0.937), greater than that of the lymphocyte:monocyte ratio (0.849; 95% CI, 0.812-0.880; P = .0007), lymphocyte percentage (0.808; 95% CI, 0.768-0.843; P < .0001), monocyte count (0.780; 95% CI, 0.739-0.817; P < .0001), or age (0.656; 95% CI, 0.610-0.699; P < .0001). The predicted probability conformed to the real observation outcomes of COVID-19, according to the calibration curves. Conclusions: We found that age, lymphocyte percentage, and monocyte count are risk factors for the early-stage prediction of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus.

Thus, the aim of this study was to establish a nomogram to detect COVID-19. Methods: A nomogram was established using data collected from 457 patients (181 with COVID-19 and 276 with influenza A or B infection) in China. The nomogram used age, lymphocyte percentage, and monocyte count to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. Results: Our nomogram predicted probabilities of COVID-19 with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.913 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.883-0.937), greater than that of the lymphocyte:monocyte ratio (0.849; 95% CI, 0.812-0.880; P = .0007), lymphocyte percentage (0.808; 95% CI, 0.768-0.843; P < .0001), monocyte count (0.780; 95% CI, 0.739-0.817; P < .0001), or age (0.656; 95% CI, 0.610-0.699; P < .0001). The predicted probability conformed to the real observation outcomes of COVID-19, according to the calibration curves. Conclusions: We found that age, lymphocyte percentage, and monocyte count are risk factors for the early-stage prediction of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus. As such, our research provides a useful test for doctors to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza."],"journal":"Open Forum Infect Dis","authors":["Wang, Linghang","Liu, Yao","Zhang, Ting","Jiang, Yuyong","Yang, Siyuan","Xu, Yanli","Song, Rui","Song, Meihua","Wang, Lin","Zhang, Wei","Han, Bing","Yang, Li","Fan, Ying","Cheng, Cheng","Wang, Jingjing","Xiang, Pan","Pu, Lin","Xiong, Haofeng","Li, Chuansheng","Zhang, Ming","Tan, Jianbo","Chen, Zhihai","Liu, Jingyuan","Wang, Xianbo"],"date":"2020-06-04T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32490031","source":"PubMed","week":"202023|Jun 01 - Jun 07","doi":"10.1093/ofid/ofaa169","keywords":["2019-ncov","covid-19","differentiating","influenza","nomogram"],"locations":["China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1668892169358802944,"score":336.81967}]}
