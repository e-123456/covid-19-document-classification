Serious complications include pneumonia, and mortality ranges from 2 to 5%. Until March 26, the World Health Organization reports 462 684 confirmed cases and 20 834 deaths worldwide.

Methods: We conducted a sensitive bibliographic search in EMBASE and ophthalmic society webpages, of the clinical practice guidelines of ophthalmic care in pandemic COVID-19. We extracted the recommendations, organizing them into three categories: \"Which patients to attend\", \"How should the clinic work\", and \"What interventions should be avoided\". For each guideline, we assessed whether the search was systematic and whether the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was followed. Results: Fourteen relevant articles were found. Fifty-one recommendations were extracted and are shown in a summary table. None are based on a systematic search for evidence, nor do any use GRADE to develop the recommendations. Conclusions: The clinical practice guidelines that we reviewed all recommend rescheduling all non-urgent consultations and surgeries, reinforcing contact precautions, the use of personal protection elements, and the disinfection of surfaces and instruments. The guidelines should be improved by incorporating systematic searches for evidence, using GRADE for recommendations, and Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) for reporting.","Medwave","Vargas-Peirano, Manuel","Navarrete, Pamela","Diaz, Traccy","Iglesias, Gabriel","Hoehmann, Martin","32469854"],"abstract":["Introduction: A new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes a respiratory distress syndrome that has been called COVID-19 and has generated an unprecedented pandemic.

This survey was designed and conducted during the lockdown period to assess its effect on ophthalmic practice and patient care in India. Methods: An online survey was sent across to practicing Indian ophthalmologists across through various social media platforms. All valid responses were tabulated and analyzed. Results: A total of 1260 ophthalmologists responded to the survey. Most of the respondents (775/1260; 61.5%) were in private practice and 14.8% (187/1260) were affiliated to ophthalmic institutes. At the time of taking the survey, 72.5% of the respondents (913/1260) were not seeing any patients due to the lockdown. Of those who were still examining patients, 82.9% (287/347) were only seeing emergency cases, based on their own clinical judgement. The proportion of ophthalmologists in ophthalmic institutes, government and municipal hospitals (126/253;49.8%) who were still seeing patients was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than those in private practice (174/775;22.4%). Apart from emergencies such as trauma, retinal detachment, and endophthalmitis (81.8%), other surgeries that were still being performed included intravitreal injections (9.1%) and cataract surgeries (5.9%). Approximately, 77.5% (976/1260) of the respondents had begun telephonic/e-mail/video consultations or consultations over social media applications since the lockdown began. In addition, 59.1% (745/1260) felt that ophthalmologists were potentially at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to other specialties while examining patients.
