Our department had formulated detailed prevention and control measures, mainly including: kidney transplant outpatient management, kidney transplantation ward management, management of kidney transplant surgery, dialysis management of patients waiting for kidney transplantation, personal protection of medical staff, follow-up management of discharged patients after kidney transplantation, etc. RESULTS: During the epidemic period, there were no COVID-19 among 68 outpatient examined kidney transplant recipients, 32 hospitalized kidney transplant recipients, 19 patients waiting for kidney transplantation in hospital and 30 medical staff. There were no COVID-19 in the follow-up of 160 recipients after kidney transplantation and 60 patients waiting for kidney transplantation. CONCLUSION: During the epidemic period, we implemented strict prevention and control measures and adjusted working methods and procedures to ensure the safe and orderly work of the department.","Transpl Int","Li, Yurong","Yang, Ning","Li, Xiaoxiao","Wang, Junpeng","Yan, Tianzhong","32357275"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To summarize measures for prevention and control of the 2019 novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) in the department of kidney transplantation.
