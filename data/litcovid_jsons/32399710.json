MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 122 patients (61 men and 61 women, 48 +/- 15 years) confirmed with COVID-19 and 48 patients (23 men and 25 women, 47 +/- 19 years) confirmed with influenza were enrolled in the study. Thin-section CT was performed. The clinical data and the chest CT findings were recorded. RESULTS: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever (74%) and cough (63%), and 102 patients (83%) had Wuhan contact. Pneumonia in 50 patients with COVID-19 (45%) distributed in the peripheral regions of the lung, while it showed mixed distribution in 26 patients (74%) with influenza (p = 0.022). The most common CT features of the COVID-19 group were pure ground-glass opacities (GGO, 36%), GGO with consolidation (51%), rounded opacities (35%), linear opacities (64%), bronchiolar wall thickening (49%), and interlobular septal thickening (66%). Compared with the influenza group, the COVID-19 group was more likely to have rounded opacities (35% vs. 17%, p = 0.048) and interlobular septal thickening (66% vs. 43%, p = 0.014), but less likely to have nodules (28% vs. 71%, p < 0.001), tree-in-bud sign (9% vs. 40%, p < 0.001), and pleural effusion (6% vs. 31%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in the CT manifestations of patients with COVID-19 and influenza.

There were no significant differences in the number of lesions, bilateral lung involvement, large irregular/patchy opacities, rounded opacities, linear opacities, crazy-paving patterns, halo signs, interlobular septal thickening or air bronchograms. CONCLUSIONS: Although peripheral pure/mixed GGOs on CT may help distinguish patients with COVID-19 from clinically suspected but negative patients, CT cannot replace RT-PCR testing. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Peripheral pure/mixed GGOs on-chest CT findings can be helpful in distinguishing patients with COVID-19 from those with clinically suspected COVID-19 but subsequently found to be COVID-19 negative."],"journal":"Br J Radiol","authors":["Xie, Sidong","Lei, Ziying","Chen, Xiuzhen","Liu, Weimin","Wang, Xiaohong","Dong, Yunxu","Guo, Yuefei","Duan, Yani","Cao, Huijuan","Qin, Jie","Lin, Bingliang"],"date":"2020-05-27T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32450727","source":"PubMed","week":"202022|May 25 - May 31","doi":"10.1259/bjr.20200243","topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1667983494527057920,"score":300.6349}]}
