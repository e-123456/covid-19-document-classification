We aim to determine whether new-onset STD are more frequent among Covid-19 patients than influenza patients. METHODS: Case-control study including hospitalized patients of two tertiary care centers. Consecutive patients positive for Covid-19 PCR (cases) and patients positive for influenza PCR (historical control sample) were assessed during specific periods, employing a self-reported STD questionnaire. RESULTS: Seventy-nine cases and 40 controls were included. No significant differences were found in basal features between both groups. New-onset STD were significantly more frequent among cases (31, 39.2%) than in the control group (5, 12.5 %), adjusted OR 21.4 (2.77-165.4, p=0.003). Covid-19 patients with new-onset STD were significantly younger than Covid-19 patients without STD (52.6 +/- 17.2 vs. 67.4 +/-15.1, p<0,001). Among Covid-19 patients who presented STD, 22 (70.9%) recalled an acute onset and was an initial manifestation in 11 (35.5%). Twenty-five (80.6%) presented smell disorders (mostly anosmia, 14, 45.2%), and 28 (90.3%) taste disorders (mostly ageusia, 14, 45.2%). Only four (12.9 %) reported concomitant nasal obstruction. Mean duration of STD was 7.5 +/- 3.2 days and 12 patients (40%) manifested complete recovery after 7.4 +/- 2.3 days of onset. CONCLUSION: New-onset STD were significantly more frequent among Covid-19 patients than influenza patients, they usually had an acute onset and were commonly an initial manifestation.

Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify predictors for COVID positivity. Selected classifiers were assessed for prediction performance using receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC). RESULTS: One-hundred and forty-five participants with positive COVID-19 testing and 157 with negative results were included. Participants had a mean age of 39 years, and 214 (72%) were female. Smell or taste change, fever, and body ache were associated with COVID-19 positivity, and shortness of breath and sore throat were associated with a negative test result (p<0.05).
