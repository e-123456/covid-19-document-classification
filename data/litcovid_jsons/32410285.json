METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 133 confirmed COVID-19 cases was conducted from January to March, 2020. They were assigned to mild group (n=65) and severe group (n=68). Univariate analysis and multivariate Logistic regression analysis were used to identify the independent predictors of severe cases. An early warning system for COVID-19 was established, with accuracy evaluated by ROC analysis. RESULTS: The age of the severe group was significantly elder than that of the mild group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in epidemiological characteristics except age between the two groups (P>0.05). Multivariate Logistic regression showed that the age, shortness of breath, lymphocyte count, PCT level, LDH level, APTT level, and CRP level were independent predictors for severe COVID-19. COVID-19 prediction model (including independent risk factors) was established, showing a high accuracy and capability for predicting higher risk of severe COVID-19 (with a AUC value of 0.8842, sensitivity value of 84.33%, and specificity value of 96.89%). CONCLUSIONS: According to the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Chongqing, a positive correlation between age and severity of COVID-19 was found, but no association between epidemiological history and disease severity was seen. Prediction model has a high sensitivity and is easy to use, which provides a strong basis for the early clinical evaluation on the severity of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.
