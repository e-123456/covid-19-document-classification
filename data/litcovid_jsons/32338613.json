OBJECTIVE: We investigated the online search queries behavior related to the COVID-19 outbreak and the attitude of infodemic monikers circulating in Italy. METHODS: By using Google Trends to explore the internet search activity related to COVID-19 from January to March 2020, titles of the articles of the most read newspapers, and government websites are mined to investigate the attitude of various infodemic monikers circulating across various regions and cities in Italy. Search volume values and average-peak value (APC) are used to quantify the results. RESULTS: Keywords such as \"novel coronavirus\", \"china coronavirus\", \"covid-19\", \"2019-ncov\", and \"sars-cov-2\" were the top infodemic and scientific COVID-19 denominations trends in Italy. Information related to face masks, amuchina (disinfectant), symptoms of the novel coronavirus, health bulletins, and vaccine for coronavirus were the top five searches related to health. The regions of Umbria and Basilicata recorded a high number of infodemic monikers (weight total APC >140). Misinformation was widely circulated in Campania region and racism related information in Umbria and Basilicata. These monikers were more frequently pronounced (weight total APC >100) in more than ten major cities in the Italy including Rome. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a growing regional and population-level interest in COVID-19 in Italy, and a majority of the searches are related to amuchina (disinfectants), face maks, health bulletin, and symptoms related to COVID-19. As a large number of infodemic monikers were observed across Italy, we recommend the health agencies can use Google Trends to predict the human behavior and also to exploit the misinformation circulating in Italy.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality and readability of online information about Wuhan Coronavirus (actually COVID-19), which was a trending topic in the net, using validated instruments and relate the quality of information to its readability. METHODS: The search was based on the term Wuhan Coronavirus on the Google website (6 February 2020). At the search time, the terms \"COVID-19\" or \"SARS-CoV-2\" did not exist yet. Critical analysis was performed on the first 110 hits using HON code, JAMA benchmark, DISCERN instrument, and Google rank. RESULTS: The Google search returned 309,000,000 hits. The first 110 websites were critically analyzed, and only 1.81% of the websites had the HON code seal.

OBJECTIVE: In light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic that started in Wuhan, China, in 2019, in this report online search traffic data from Google are used aiming at tracking the spread of the new Coronavirus. METHODS: Time-series from Google Trends from January to March 2020 on the topic of \"Coronavirus\" are retrieved and correlated with official data on COVID-19 cases and deaths in the European countries that have been affected the most; Italy (at national and regional level), Spain, France, Germany, and the UK.
