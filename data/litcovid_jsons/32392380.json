METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted by distributing online questionnaires to 2430 adult members (> 18 years) of two user panels consisting of people with diabetes who have volunteered to share information about their life with diabetes. The questionnaire included items on COVID-19-specific worries as well as such worries related to diabetes, sociodemographic and health status, social relations, diabetes-specific social support, diabetes distress and changes in diabetes-specific behaviours. Responses were analysed with descriptive statistics and logistic regressions. RESULTS: People with diabetes have COVID-19-specific worries related to their diabetes. More than half were worried about being overly affected due to diabetes if infected with COVID-19, about one-third about being characterized as a risk group due to diabetes and not being able to manage diabetes if infected. Logistic regressions showed that being female, having type 1 diabetes, diabetes complications and diabetes distress, feeling isolated and lonely, and having changed diabetes behaviours were associated with being more worried about COVID-19 and diabetes. CONCLUSION: People with diabetes have COVID-19-specific worries related to their diabetes which is associated with poorer psychosocial health.

However, worry, which is a key motivator of behavioral health changes, occurs less frequently for older than younger adults, and less frequently for men than women.

METHODS: From March 23-31, 2020, we administered an online questionnaire assessing COVID-19 perceptions, worries, and behavior changes. Participants were a convenience sample of United States residents, who were community-dwelling younger adults (18-35) or older adults (65 to 81). Analyses included 146 younger adults (68 men, 78 women) and 156 older adults (82 men, 74 women). Participants was predominately White, living in suburban/urban areas, and had completed some college. RESULTS: During the early phase of the outbreak in the United States, older adults perceived the risks of COVID-19 to be higher than did younger adults. Despite this, older men were comparatively less worried about COVID-19 than their younger counterparts. Compared to the other participants, older men had also implemented the fewest behavior changes.
