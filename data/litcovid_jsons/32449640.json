With the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on social security schemes and individuals' income, dependent older people's needs are critically at stake. Like other developing countries, older people in Ghana need to rely on their social networks through family ties, friends and social organisations for support. Also, there is the need for social security institutions, including the Social Security and National insurance Trust, to make provisions for older people aged 50+ to receive part of their pension package to meet their basic needs during the pandemic. In a period like this, social services are required as older people may need practical support in terms of having someone to run errands for them. However, government should improve social intervention package, particularly the livelihood empowerment against poverty grant for older adults with very low income in order to enhance their living conditions.","J Gerontol Soc Work","Arthur-Holmes, Francis","Agyemang-Duah, Williams","32449640"],"abstract":["Throughout the world, the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has exposed the older population to health, social and financial risks.

On 19-24 March 2020 we fielded a national, web-based survey (53% response rate) among adults with <250% of the federal poverty line in the US (N = 1478). Measures included household food security status and COVID-19-related basic needs challenges. Overall, 36% of low-income adults in the US were food secure, 20% had marginal food security, and 44% were food insecure. Less than one in five (18.8%) of adults with very low food security reported being able to comply with public health recommendations to purchase two weeks of food at a time. For every basic needs challenge, food-insecure adults were significantly more likely to report facing that challenge, with a clear gradient effect based on severity of food security. The short-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are magnifying existing disparities and disproportionately affecting low-income, food-insecure households that already struggle to meet basic needs.
