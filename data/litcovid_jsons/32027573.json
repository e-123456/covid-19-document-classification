Multiple patchy ground glass opacities in bilateral multiple lobular with periphery distribution are typical chest CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia."],"journal":"Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging","authors":["Xu, Xi","Yu, Chengcheng","Qu, Jing","Zhang, Lieguang","Jiang, Songfeng","Huang, Deyang","Chen, Bihua","Zhang, Zhiping","Guan, Wanhua","Ling, Zhoukun","Jiang, Rui","Hu, Tianli","Ding, Yan","Lin, Lin","Gan, Qingxin","Luo, Liangping","Tang, Xiaoping","Liu, Jinxin"],"date":"2020-02-29T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32107577","week":"20209|Feb 24 - Mar 01","doi":"10.1007/s00259-020-04735-9","keywords":["2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia","COVID-19","Computed tomography","Ground glass opacification","Imaging features","Infection","SARS-CoV-2"],"source":"PubMed","locations":["Guangzhou","Wuhan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Mechanism","Case Report"],"weight":1,"_version_":1661359647497388032,"score":261.80283}]}
