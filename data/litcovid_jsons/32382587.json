The aim of this study was to describe specific clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 with a history of stroke. METHODS: All the confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Tongji Hospital from January 27 to March 5, 2020, were included in our cohort study. Clinical data were analyzed and compared between patients with and without a history of stroke. RESULTS: Of the included 1875 patients with COVID-19, 50 patients had a history of stroke. The COVID-19 patients with medical history of stroke were older with more comorbidities, had higher neutrophil count, and lower lymphocyte and platelet counts than those without history of stroke. The levels of D-dimers, cardiac troponin I, NT pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and interleukin-6 were also markedly higher in patients with history of stroke. Stroke survivors who underwent COVID-19 developed more acute respiratory distress syndrome and received more noninvasive mechanical ventilation.
