The question has been raised on whether DPP4 modulation or inhibition may prevent infection and/or progression of the COVID-19.

Although a direct involvement of DPP4 in SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be clarified, there is also evidence suggesting that DPP4i modulate inflammation and exert anti-fibrotic activity.
