On Feb 20-21, 2020, we surveyed 369 adults in 64 cities in China that varied in their rates of confirmed coronavirus cases on their health conditions, distress and life satisfaction. 27% of the participants worked at the office, 38% resorted to working from home, and 25% stopped working due to the outbreak. Those who stopped working reported worse mental and physical health conditions as well as distress. The severity of COVID-19 in an individual's home city predicts their life satisfaction, and this relationship is contingent upon individuals' existing chronic health issues and their hours of exercise. Our evidence supports the need to pay attention to the health of people who were not infected by the virus, especially for people who stopped working during the outbreak. Our results highlight that physically active people might be more susceptible to wellbeing issues during the lockdown. Policymakers who are considering introducing restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 may benefit from understanding such health and wellbeing implications.","Psychiatry Res","Zhang, Stephen X","Wang, Yifei","Rauch, Andreas","Wei, Feng","32283450"],"abstract":["We assess the health and wellbeing of normal adults living and working after one month of confinement to contain the COVID-19 outbreak in China.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a major threat to public health. Nurses have always played an important role in infection prevention, infection control, isolation, containment, and public health. However, available data on the work stress among these nurses is limited. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey. An online questionnaire was completed by 180 anti-epidemic nurses from Guangxi. Data collection tools, including the Chinese version of the Stress Overload Scale (SOS) and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Descriptive, single factor, correlation, and multiple regression analyses were used in exploring related influencing factors. RESULTS: The SOS (39.91+/-12.92) and SAS scores (32.19+/-7.56) of this nurse group were positively correlated (r=0.676, p<0.05).
