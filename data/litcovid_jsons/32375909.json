Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) related to SARS-CoV-2 has brought serious attacks to China and the world. Therefore, we intend to shed light on its potential clinical and epidemiological characteristics. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 50 confirmed death cases of SARS-CoV-2 on Chinese official media networks from 16 Jan, 2020 to 5 Feb, 2020. All the cases were confirmed by local qualified medical and health institutions. Their specific information has been released through official channels. According to the contents of the reports, we recorded in detail the sex, age, first symptom date, death date, primary symptoms, chronic fundamental diseases and other data of the patients, and carried out analysis and discussion. RESULTS: In total 50 death cases, the median age of them was 70 years old, and male was 2.33 times more likely than female. The median days from the first symptom to death were 13 days, and it tended to be shorter among people aged 65 and above than those with ages under 65 (12 days vs. 17 days, P = 0.046). There was a negative correlation between age and the days from the first symptom to death (r = -0.40, P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: In our study, we found that most of the deaths were elderly men with chronic fundamental diseases, and their COVID-19 progress is shorter. At the same time, we demonstrated that older men are more likely to be infected with covid-19 and the risk of death is positively correlated with age.","Disaster Med Public Health Prep","Chen, Yiguang","Li, Tianhua","Ye, Yongyi","Chen, Yongjian","Pan, Jun","32375909"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 appeared in Wuhan, China.

Methods: In this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time. Findings: We collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35-60). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children. Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0.0009). Although our sample captures only 507 (5.2%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020.
