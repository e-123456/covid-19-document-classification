Both drugs may increase risk of lethal arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation. Methods and Results We performed a case series of COVID-19 positive/suspected patients admitted between 2/1/2020 and 4/4/2020 who were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, or a combination. We evaluated baseline and post-medication QT interval (QTc, Bazett's) using 12-lead ECGs. Critical QTc prolongation was defined as: a) maximum QTc >/=500 ms (if QRS <120 ms) or QTc >/=550 ms (if QRS >/=120 ms) and b) increased QTc of >/=60 ms. Tisdale score and Elixhauser comorbidity index were calculated. Of 490 COVID-19 positive/suspected patients, 314 (64%) received either/both drugs, and 98 (73 COVID-19 positive, 25 suspected) met study criteria (age 62+/-17 yrs, 61% male). Azithromycin was prescribed in 28%, hydroxychloroquine in 10%, and both in 62%. Baseline mean QTc was 448+/-29 ms and increased to 459+/-36 ms (p=0.005) with medications. Significant prolongation was observed only in men (18+/-43 ms vs -0.2+/-28 ms in women, p=0.02). 12% of patients reached critical QTc prolongation. Changes in QTc were highest with the combination compared to either drug, with much greater prolongation with combination vs. azithromycin (17+/-39 vs. 0.5+/-40 ms, p=0.07). No patients manifested torsades de pointes. Conclusions Overall 12% of patients manifested critical QTc prolongation, and the combination caused greater prolongation than either drug alone.

Small studies have shown a potential benefit of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine +/- azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19. Use of these medications alone, or in combination, can lead to a prolongation of the QT interval, possibly increasing the risk of Torsade de pointes (TdP) and sudden cardiac death. Methods - Hospitalized patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine +/- azithromycin from March 1st through the 23rd at three hospitals within the Northwell Health system were included in this prospective, observational study. Serial assessments of the QT interval were performed. The primary outcome was QT prolongation resulting in TdP. Secondary outcomes included QT prolongation, the need to prematurely discontinue any of the medications due to QT prolongation and arrhythmogenic death. Results - Two hundred one patients were treated for COVID-19 with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. Ten patients (5.0%) received chloroquine, 191 (95.0%) received hydroxychloroquine and 119 (59.2%) also received azithromycin. The primary outcome of TdP was not observed in the entire population.
