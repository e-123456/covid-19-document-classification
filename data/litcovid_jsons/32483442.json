Methods: The consecutive records of 93 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital from January 10, 2020, to February 22, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. A series of chest CT findings and clinical data were collected and analyzed. The serial chest CT scans were scored on a semiquantitative basis according to the extent of pulmonary abnormalities. Chest CT scores in different periods (0 - 5 days, 6 - 10 days, 11 - 15 days, 16 - 20 days, and > 20 days) since symptom onset were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors, and the temporal trend of the radiographic-clinical features was analyzed. Results: The final cohort consisted of 93 patients: 68 survivors and 25 nonsurvivors. Nonsurvivors were significantly older than survivors. For both survivors and nonsurvivors, the chest CT scores were not different in the first period (0 - 5 days) but diverged afterwards. The mortality rate of COVID-19 monotonously increased with chest CT scores, which positively correlated with the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil percentage, D-dimer level, lactate dehydrogenase level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, while negatively correlated with the lymphocyte percentage and lymphocyte count. Conclusions: Chest CT scores correlate well with risk factors for mortality over periods, thus they may be used as a prognostic indicator in COVID-19. While higher chest CT scores are associated with a higher mortality rate, CT images taken at least 6 days since symptom onset may contain more prognostic information than images taken at an earlier period.","Theranostics","Li, Lingli","Yang, Lian","Gui, Shan","Pan, Feng","Ye, Tianhe","Liang, Bo","Hu, Yu","Zheng, Chuansheng","32483442"],"abstract":["Rationale: To retrospectively analyze serial chest CT and clinical features in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for the assessment of temporal changes and to investigate how the changes differ in survivors and nonsurvivors.

The mortality rate was 4.0% (40 cases). The median age of nonsurvivors (68 years) was significantly older than survivors (62 years).
