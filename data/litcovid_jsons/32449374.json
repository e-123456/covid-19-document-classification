Non-survivor patients had a significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP) (MD: 46.37, 95% CI: 20.84, 71.90; P= 0.001), white blood cells (WBCs) (MD: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.53, 4.67; P< 0.001) and lower lymphocyte (MD: -8.75, 95% CI: -12.62, -4.87; P< 0.001) compared to survivor patients Data analysis showed that comorbid conditions (aRR: 2.99, 95%CI: 1.09, 8.21, P= 0.034), higher CRP levels (aRR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.03, P= 0.044), and lower lymphocyte (aRR: 0.82, 95%CI: 0.73, 0.93, P= 0.003) were associated with increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, most non-survivors are elderly with comorbidities. Lymphopenia and increased levels of WBCs along with elevated CRP were associated with increased risk of death. Therefore, it is best to be regularly assessed these markers during treatment of COVID-19 patients."],"journal":"Rom J Intern Med","authors":["Javanian, Mostafa","Bayani, Masomeh","Shokri, Mehran","Sadeghi-Haddad-Zavareh, Mahmoud","Babazadeh, Arefeh","Yeganeh, Babak","Mohseni, Sima","Mehraein, Raheleh","Sepidarkish, Mahdi","Bijani, Ali","Rostami, Ali","Shahbazi, Mehdi","Tabari, Afrooz Monadi","Shabani, Asieh","Masrour-Roudsari, Jila","Hasanpour, Amir Hossein","Gholinejad, Hossein Emam","Ghorbani, Hossein","Ebrahimpour, Soheil"],"date":"2020-05-13T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32396143","source":"PubMed","week":"202020|May 11 - May 17","doi":"10.2478/rjim-2020-0013","keywords":["c-reactive protein","covid-19","elderly","leukocyte count","lymphopenia","mortality","pneumonia"],"locations":["China","Lymphopenia","Babol North","Iran"],"countries":["China","Iran, Islamic Republic of"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China","IRN|Iran, Islamic Republic of"],"topics":["Treatment","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666627827885146112,"score":298.106}]}
