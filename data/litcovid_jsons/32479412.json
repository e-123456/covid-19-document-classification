OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand whether oropharyngeal swab (OPS), saliva and dried blood spot (DBS) specimens participant-collected at home and mailed to a laboratory were sufficient for use in diagnostic and serology tests. METHODS: Eligible participants were consented online and mailed a participant-collection kit to support collection of three specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing; saliva, OPS, and DBS. Participants performed specimen collection while clinical observers watched through a telehealth video appointment and documented the suitability of the collection. The biological sufficiency of specimens for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and serology testing was assessed by laboratorians using visual inspection and quantification of nucleic acid content of samples by RNase P measurements. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-three participants returned their kits and are included in this analysis (out of 159 enrolled (96%). All attended their video appointments. Clinical observers assessed that, of the samples collected, 96% of saliva, 97% of OPS and 93% of the DBS samples were of sufficient quality for submission for laboratory testing; 100% OPS and 99% of saliva had Ct values RNase P <30, indicating sufficient nucleic acid for RNA-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2.

Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cornerstone of an effective public health response. However, efforts to test have been hampered by limited reagents, limitations in the availability of swabs used for the collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens, limitations in personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care providers collecting the NPS specimens, and limitations in viral transport media for transporting the specimens. Therefore, more flexible options for screening for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses are critical to inform clinical and public health responses. OBJECTIVE: We aim to document the ability of patients to self-collect sufficient specimens for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection and serology. METHODS: Patient self-collection of samples will be done with observation by a health care provider during a telemedicine session. Participants will be mailed a specimen collection kit, engage in a telehealth session with a provider through a HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996)-compliant video meeting, and collect specimens while being observed by the provider.
