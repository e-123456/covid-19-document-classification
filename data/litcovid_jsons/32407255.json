Purpose The purpose of this study was to analyze the prognostic value of a CXR severity scoring system for younger (non-elderly) patients with COVID-19 upon initial presentation to the emergency department (ED). Outcomes of interest included hospitalization, intubation, prolonged stay, sepsis, and death. Materials & Methods In this retrospective study, patients between the ages of 21 and 50 years who presented to EDs of an urban multicenter health system from March 10 - 26, 2020 with COVID-19 confirmation on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were identified. Each patient's ED CXR was divided into 6 zones and examined for opacities by two cardiothoracic radiologists with scores collated into a total concordant lung zone severity score.
