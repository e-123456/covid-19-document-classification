We aimed to assess the incidence and outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in an urban region during the pandemic, compared with non-pandemic periods. METHODS: We did a population-based, observational study using data for non-traumatic OHCA (N=30 768), systematically collected since May 15, 2011, in Paris and its suburbs, France, using the Paris Fire Brigade database, together with in-hospital data. We evaluated OHCA incidence and outcomes over a 6-week period during the pandemic in adult inhabitants of the study area. FINDINGS: Comparing the 521 OHCAs of the pandemic period (March 16 to April 26, 2020) to the mean of the 3052 total of the same weeks in the non-pandemic period (weeks 12-17, 2012-19), the maximum weekly OHCA incidence increased from 13.42 (95% CI 12.77-14.07) to 26.64 (25.72-27.53) per million inhabitants (p<0.0001), before returning to normal in the final weeks of the pandemic period. Although patient demographics did not change substantially during the pandemic compared with the non-pandemic period (mean age 69.7 years [SD 17] vs 68.5 [18], 334 males [64.4%] vs 1826 [59.9%]), there was a higher rate of OHCA at home (460 [90.2%] vs 2336 [76.8%]; p<0.0001), less bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (239 [47.8%] vs 1165 [63.9%]; p<0.0001) and shockable rhythm (46 [9.2%] vs 472 [19.1%]; p<0.0001), and longer delays to intervention (median 10.4 min [IQR 8.4-13.8] vs 9.4 min [7.9-12.6]; p<0.0001). The proportion of patients who had an OHCA and were admitted alive decreased from 22.8% to 12.8% (p<0.0001) in the pandemic period.
