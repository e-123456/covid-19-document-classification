Cumulative number of new confirmed case and death are still increasing out of China. However, the independent predicted factors associated with the fatal outcome remain uncertain. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 1590 hospitalized subjects with COVID-19 throughout China was established. The prognostic effects of variables, including clinical features and laboratory findings, were analyzed using Kapla-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model. A prognostic nomogram was formulated to predict the survival of patient with COVID-19. RESULTS: In this nationwide cohort, non-survivors showed higher incidence of elderly people, subjects with co-existing chronic illness, dyspnea and laboratory abnormalities on admission, compared with survivors. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age>/=75 (HR: 7.86, 95% CI: 2.44-25.35), age between 65-74 years (HR:3.43, 95%CI: 1.24-9.5), coronary heart disease (HR:4.28, 95%CI:1.14-16.13), cerebrovascular disease(HR:3.1, 95%CI:1.07-8.94), dyspnea (HR: 3.96, 95%CI:1.42-11), procalcitonin>0.5ng/ml(HR:8.72, 95%CI:3.42-22.28), aspartate aminotransferase>40U/liter (HR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1- 6.73) were independent risk factors associated with fatal outcome.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (>/=18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. FINDINGS: 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).

The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. INTERPRETATION: The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 mug/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.
