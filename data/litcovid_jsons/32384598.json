An Analysis of Consumer Data during the Period of COVID-19 in China.","How to overcome informational conformity consumer behavior when faced with threats of death is a social problem in response to COVID-19. This research is based on the terror management theory, the need to belong theory and the materialism theory. It uses a theoretical model to determine the relationships between threats of death and informational conformity consumer behavior. From 1453 samples collected during outbreak of COVID-19 in China, we used a structural equation model to test multiple research hypotheses. The result shows that threats of death are positively associated with a need to belong, materialism and informational conformity consumer behavior. The need to belong and materialism can play a mediating role between threats of death and information conformity consumption behavior, and perceived social support can play a moderating role between threats of death and information conformity consumption behavior.","Int J Environ Res Public Health","Song, Wei","Jin, Xiaotong","Gao, Jian","Zhao, Taiyang","32384598"],"abstract":["How to overcome informational conformity consumer behavior when faced with threats of death is a social problem in response to COVID-19.

METHODS: To test the proposed model, we collected data with an online survey (N=225) and analyzed it using partial least square-structural equation modeling.
