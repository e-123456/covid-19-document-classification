RESULTS: The 4 hospitals shifted from a high-volume proctological activity to almost \"zero\" visits and surgery. Every patient accessing the hospital must respect a specific COVID-19 protocol.

Changes in the clinical management of the proctological disease are presented together with some considerations to be explored. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of scientific evidence, these practical considerations may be valuable to proctological surgeons starting to face the COVID-19 pandemics.
