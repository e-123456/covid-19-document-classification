As hospital resources and staff become more limited during the COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes critically important to define which BC patients require more urgent care and which patients can wait for treatment until the pandemic is over. In this Special Communication, we use expert opinion of representatives from multiple cancer care organizations to categorize BC patients into priority levels (A, B, C) for urgency of care across all specialties. Additionally, we provide treatment recommendations for each of these patient scenarios. Priority A patients have conditions that are immediately life threatening or symptomatic requiring urgent treatment. Priority B patients have conditions that do not require immediate treatment but should start treatment before the pandemic is over. Priority C patients have conditions that can be safely deferred until the pandemic is over. The implementation of these recommendations for patient triage, which are based on the highest level available evidence, must be adapted to current availability of hospital resources and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in each region of the country. Additionally, the risk of disease progression and worse outcomes for patients need to be weighed against the risk of patient and staff exposure to SARS CoV-2 (virus associated with the COVID-19 pandemic). Physicians should use these recommendations to prioritize care for their BC patients and adapt treatment recommendations to the local context at their hospital.","Breast Cancer Res Treat","Dietz, Jill R","Moran, Meena S","Isakoff, Steven J","Kurtzman, Scott H","Willey, Shawna C","Burstein, Harold J","Bleicher, Richard J","Lyons, Janice A","Sarantou, Terry","Baron, Paul L","Stevens, Randy E","Boolbol, Susan K","Anderson, Benjamin O","Shulman, Lawrence N","Gradishar, William J","Monticciolo, Debra L","Plecha, Donna M","Nelson, Heidi","Yao, Katharine A","32333293"],"abstract":["The COVID-19 pandemic presents clinicians a unique set of challenges in managing breast cancer (BC) patients.

In the setting of anticipated resource constraints and widespread community infection with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic, measures for balancing both infectious and oncologic risk among patients and providers must be carefully considered. Here, we present evidence-based guidelines for omitting or abbreviating breast cancer radiotherapy, where appropriate, in an effort to mitigate risk to patients and optimize resource utilization. Methods: Multidisciplinary breast cancer experts at a high-volume comprehensive cancer center convened contingency planning meetings over the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to review the relevant literature and establish recommendations for the application of hypofractionated and abbreviated breast radiation regimens. Results: Substantial evidence exists to support omitting radiation among certain favorable risk subgroups of breast cancer patients and for abbreviating or accelerating regimens among others. For those who require either whole-breast or post-mastectomy radiation, with or without coverage of the regional lymph nodes, a growing body of literature supports various hypofractionated approaches that appear safe and effective. Conclusion: In the setting of a public health emergency with the potential to strain critical healthcare resources and place patients at infection risk, the parsimonious application of breast radiotherapy may alleviate a significant clinical burden without compromising long term oncologic outcomes. The judicious and personalized use of immature study data may be warranted in the setting of a competing mortality risk from this widespread pandemic.","Adv Radiat Oncol","Braunstein, Lior Z","Gillespie, Erin F","Hong, Linda","Xu, Amy","Bakhoum, Samuel F","Cuaron, John","Mueller, Boris","McCormick, Beryl","Cahlon, Oren","Powell, Simon","Khan, Atif J","32292842"],"abstract":["Introduction: Breast radiotherapy accounts for a significant proportion of patient volume in contemporary radiation oncology practice.
