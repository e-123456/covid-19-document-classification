Patients in the death group exhibited significantly lower lymphocyte count (0.63 [0.40, 0.79] x 10/L vs. 1.00 [0.72, 1.27] x 10/L, Z = 8.037, P < 0.001) and lymphocyte/WBC ratio (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs. 23.5 [15.27, 31.25]%, Z = 10.315, P < 0.001) on admission, and the lymphocyte/WBC ratio continue to decrease during hospitalization (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs. 2.91 [1.79, 6.13]%, Z = 5.242, P < 0.001). Alanine transaminase (ALT) (22.00 [15.00, 34.00] U/L vs. 18.70 [13.00, 30.38] U/L, Z = 2.592, P = 0.010), aspartate transaminase (AST) (34.00 [27.00, 47.00] U/L vs. 22.00 [17.65, 31.75] U/L, Z = 7.308, P < 0.001), and creatinine levels (89.00 [72.00, 133.50] mumol/L vs.65.00 [54.60, 78.75] mumol/L, Z = 6.478, P < 0.001) were significantly higher in the death group that those in the recovered group. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also significantly higher in the death group on admission (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] mg/L vs.3.22 [1.04, 21.80] mg/L, Z = 10.206, P < 0.001) showed no significant improvement after treatment (109.25 [35.0, 170.28] mg/L vs. 81.60 [27.23, 179.08] mg/L, Z = 1.219, P = 0.233). The patients in the death group had more complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (89.9% vs. 7.6%, chi = 148.105, P < 0.001), acute cardiac injury (59.6% vs. 0.8%, chi = 93.222, P < 0.001), acute kidney injury (18.3% vs. 0, chi = 23.257, P < 0.001), shock (11.9% vs. 0, chi = 14.618, P < 0.001), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (6.4% vs. 0, chi = 7.655, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the recovered group, more patients in the death group exhibited characteristics of advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities, dyspnea, oxygen saturation decrease, increased WBC count, decreased lymphocytes, and elevated CRP levels. More patients in the death groups had complications such as ARDS, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, shock, and DIC."],"journal":"Chin Med J (Engl)","authors":["Deng, Yan","Liu, Wei","Liu, Kui","Fang, Yuan-Yuan","Shang, Jin","Zhou, Ling","Wang, Ke","Leng, Fan","Wei, Shuang","Chen, Lei","Liu, Hui-Guo"],"date":"2020-03-27T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32209890","week":"202013|Mar 23 - Mar 29","doi":"10.1097/CM9.0000000000000824","source":"PubMed","locations":["China","Wuhan"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1663095625831415808,"score":217.20323}]}
