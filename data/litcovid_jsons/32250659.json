Hypertension has been widely reported to be associated with increase disease severity, however, other studies have reported different findings. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association of hypertension and severe and fatal COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Scopus, Medline, and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting the rate of hypertension in COVID-19 patients with severe or non-severe disease or among survivors and non-survivors. The obtained data was pooled into a meta-analysis to calculate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: Hypertension was associated with a nearly 2.5-fold significantly increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease (OR: 2.49 [95%CI: 1.98-3.12] I2=24%), as well as with a similarly significant higher risk of mortality (OR: 2.42 [95%CI: 1.51-3.90] I2=0%). In meta-regression, a significant correlation was observed with an increase in mean age of patients with severe COVID-19 associated with increased log odds of hypertension and severity (p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pooled analysis of the current scientific literature would suggest that hypertension may be associated with an up to 2.5-fold higher risk of severe and fatal COVID-19, especially among older individuals.","Pol Arch Intern Med","Lippi, Giuseppe","Wong, Johnny","Henry, Brandon Michael","32231171"],"abstract":["INTRODUCTION: As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, identification of clinical predictors of severe or fatal disease are necessary to enable risk stratification and optimize allocation of limited resources.
