Similar compounds, which are embedded to proximate points on the 2-D map, may bind the same or similar target proteins. Thus, iBioProVis can be used to easily observe the structural distribution of one or two target proteins' known ligands on the 2-D compound space, and to infer new binders to the same protein, or to infer new potential target(s) for a compound of interest, based on this distribution. Principal component analysis (PCA) projection of the input compounds is also provided, Hence the user can interactively observe the same compound or a group of selected compounds which is projected by both PCA and embedded by t-SNE. iBioProVis also provides detailed information about drugs and drug candidate compounds through cross-references to widely used and well-known databases, in the form of linked table views. Two use-case studies were demonstrated, one being on ACE2 protein which is SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor. ACE2 binding compounds and 7 antiviral drugs were closely embedded in which two of them have been under clinical trial for COVID-19.
