Sargramostim is a man-made form of the naturally-occurring protein GM-CSF. TRIAL DESIGN: A phase 4 academic, prospective, 2 arm (1:1 ratio), randomized, open-label, controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18-80 years admitted to specialized COVID-19 wards in 5 Belgian hospitals with recent (< 2 weeks prior to randomization) confirmed COVID-19 infection and acute respiratory failure defined as a PaO2/FiO2 below 350 mmHg or SpO2 below 93% on minimal 2 L/min supplemental oxygen. Patients were excluded from the trial in case of (1) known serious allergic reactions to yeast-derived products, (2) lithium carbonate therapy, (3) mechanical ventilation prior to randomization, (4) peripheral white blood cell count above 25.000/muL and/or active myeloid malignancy, (5) high dose systemic steroid therapy (> 20 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent), (6) enrolment in another investigational study, (7) pregnant or breastfeeding or (8) ferritin levels > 2000 mug/mL. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Inhaled sargramostim 125 mug twice daily for 5 days in addition to standard care. Upon progression of disease requiring mechanical ventilation or to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and initiation of mechanical ventilator support within the 5 day period, inhaled sargramostim will be replaced by intravenous sargramostim 125 mug/m(2) body surface area once daily until the 5 day period is reached. From day 6 onwards, progressive patients in the active group will have the option to receive an additional 5 days of IV sargramostim, based on the treating physician's assessment. Intervention will be compared to standard of care. Subjects progressing to ARDS and requiring invasive mechanical ventilatory support, from day 6 onwards in the standard of care group will have the option (clinician's decision) to initiate IV sargramostim 125m mug/m(2) body surface area once daily for 5 days. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint of this intervention is measuring oxygenation after 5 days of inhaled (and intravenous) treatment through assessment of a change in pretreatment and post-treatment ratio of PaO2/FiO2 and through measurement of the P(A-a)O2 gradient (PAO2= Partial alveolar pressure of oxygen, PaO2=Partial arterial pressure of oxygen; FiO2= Fraction of inspired oxygen).

BLINDING (MASKING): In this open-label trial neither participants, caregivers, nor those assessing the outcomes will be blinded to group assignment.

The number of virions of SARS-CoV-2 was observed under transmission electron microscope after treatment with LS. Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. The results showed that LS could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, and reduce the number of virus particles and it could markedly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-8, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels. Moreover, the expression of the key proteins in the NF-kappaB/MAPK signaling pathway was detected by western blot and it was found that LS could inhibit the expression of p-NF-kappaB p65, p-IkappaBalpha and p-p38 MAPK, while increasing the expression of IkappaBalpha. These findings indicate that LS could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection via downregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced virus and regulating the activity of NF-kappaB/MAPK signaling pathway in vitro, making its promising candidate treatment for controlling COVID-19 disease."],"journal":"Pharmacol Res","authors":["Ma, Qinhai","Pan, Weiqi","Li, Runfeng","Liu, Bin","Li, Chufang","Xie, Yuqi","Wang, Zhoulang","Zhao, Jin","Jiang, Haiming","Huang, Jicheng","Shi, Yongxia","Dai, Jun","Zheng, Kui","Li, Xiaobo","Yang, Zifeng"],"date":"2020-05-04T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32360580","source":"PubMed","week":"202019|May 04 - May 10","doi":"10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104850","keywords":["liu shen capsule","sars-cov-2","anti-inflammatory","antiviral"],"locations":["Chinese"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Treatment","Mechanism"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138495914082304,"score":135.83632}]}
