METHODS: Using PubMed, Embase and Medline, articles published between January and April 2020 on Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and resources from World Health Organisation were analyzed in order to have an understanding of the clinical characteristics, transmission dynamics, virology, diagnostic possibilities, prevention, management approach, controversies and impact of COVID-19 on the healthcare workforce. RESULTS: Our review revealed that COVID-19 patients present with a myriad of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe respiratory disease, which can often be fatal. The mode of transmission via droplet infections makes it unduly contagious and difficult to control. Currently, antiviral drugs or vaccines are being developed to manage this condition. CONCLUSION: There is urgent need for potent antivirals and vaccine to manage those infected with COVID 19 and prevent infection.
