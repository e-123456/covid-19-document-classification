METHODS: Specificity was evaluated in 103 samples collected before January 2020. Sensitivity and time to seropositivity was evaluated in samples from 94 patients with COVID-19 confirmed with PCR on nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: Specificity [confidence interval] of lateral flow assays (LFA) was >/= 91.3% [84.0-95.5] for IgM, >/= 90.3% [82.9-94.8] for IgG, and >/= 85.4% [77.2-91.1] for the combination IgM OR IgG. Specificity of the ELISA was 96.1% [90.1-98.8] for IgG and only 73.8% [64.5-81.4] for IgA.

Positivity of IgM OR IgG for LFA resulted in a decrease in specificity compared to IgG alone without a gain in diagnostic performance except for VivaDiag. The results for IgM varied significantly between the LFA with an average overall agreement of only 70% compared to 89% for IgG.

METHODS: Patients presenting to a Dutch teaching hospital were eligible between March 17 and April 10, 2020, when they had respiratory symptoms that were suspected for COVID-19. The performances of six different LFAs were evaluated in plasma samples obtained on corresponding respiratory sample dates of NATs testing. Subsequently, the best performing LFA was evaluated in 228 patients and in 50 sera of a historical patient control group. RESULTS: In the pilot analysis sensitivity characteristics of LFA were heterogenous ranging from 2/20 (10%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0-23) to 11/20 (55%; 95% CI 33-77). In the total cohort, Orient Gene Biotech COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test LFA had a sensitivity of 43/99 (43%; 95% CI 34-53) and specificity of 126/129 (98%; 95% CI 95-100).
