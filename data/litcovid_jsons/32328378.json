A total of 507 human-origin viruses were regarded as positive samples, whereas 2159 non-human-origin viruses were regarded as negative. To capture the key information of the spike protein, three feature encoding algorithms (amino acid composition, AAC; parallel correlation-based pseudo-amino-acid composition, PC-PseAAC and G-gap dipeptide composition, GGAP) were used to train 41 random forest models. The optimal feature with the best performance was identified by the multidimensional scaling method, which was used to explore the pattern of human coronavirus. RESULTS: The 10-fold cross-validation results showed that well performance was achieved with the use of the GGAP (g = 3) feature.

The smooth distance curve for SARS-CoV suggests that its close relatives still exist in nature and public health is challenged as usual.
