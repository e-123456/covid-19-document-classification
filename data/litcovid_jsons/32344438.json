MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was designed to differentiate the impact of the pandemic on inpatient and outpatient nuclear medicine operations and on public versus private health systems, respectively. Questions were addressing the following issues: impact on nuclear medicine diagnostics and therapy, use of recommendations, personal protective equipment, and organizational adaptations. The survey was available for 6 days and closed on April 20, 2020. RESULTS: 113 complete responses were recorded. Nearly all participants (97 %) report a decline of nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures. The mean reduction in the last three weeks for PET/CT, scintigraphies of bone, myocardium, lung thyroid, sentinel lymph-node are -14.4 %, -47.2 %, -47.5 %, -40.7 %, -58.4 %, and -25.2 % respectively. Furthermore, 76 % of the participants report a reduction in therapies especially for benign thyroid disease (-41.8 %) and radiosynoviorthesis (-53.8 %) while tumor therapies remained mainly stable. 48 % of the participants report a shortage of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear medicine services are notably reduced 3 weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reached Germany, Austria and Switzerland on a large scale. We must be aware that the current crisis will also have a significant economic impact on the healthcare system.

The Young Group of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine (AIMN) developed the first international survey to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in nuclear medicine (NM). The aim of this study was to perform a preliminary report of the ongoing survey. METHODS: A questionnaire of thirty questions was prepared for all NM professionals addressing three main issues: (1) new scheduling praxes for NM diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, (2) assistance of patients with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and (3) prevention of COVID-19 spreading in the departments. An invitation to the survey was sent to the corresponding authors of NM scientific papers indexed in SCOPUS in 2019. Personal data were analysed per individual responder. Organisation data were evaluated per single department. RESULTS: Two-hundred and ninety-six individual responders from 220 departments were evaluated. Most of the responders were from Europe (199/296, 67%). Approximately, all departments already changed their scheduling praxes due to the pandemic (213/220, 97%). In most departments, scheduled diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were allowed but quantitatively reduced (112/220, 51%). A significant reduction of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (more than 20%) affected 198/220 (90%) and 158/220 (72%) departments, respectively. Incidental COVID-19 signs in NM exams occurred in 106/220 departments (48%). Few departments were closed or shifted to assist patients with COVID-19 (36/220, 16%). Most of the responders thought that pandemic would not permanently change the work of NM departments in the future (189/296, 64%).

Health care systems globally are amid an unprecedented challenge. Since its emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread to 185 countries worldwide, with more than 2.63 million cases confirmed and more than 183 thousand related deaths (as of 23/04/2020). According to current evidence, the novel coronavirus is transmitted from human-to-human mainly via respiratory droplets of different sizes, contact with bodily fluids, or from contaminated surfaces. In the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures that generate aerosols are performed. The common clinical symptoms of the highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic virus include fever, cough, fatigue, ageusia and anosmia and in some patients, gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and patients with comorbidities are susceptible to infection and prone to severe complications, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokines storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. Under these circumstances, it is critical for health care settings, including nuclear medicine departments to take infection control measures, to prevent a potential spread not just among patients but also to staff members as well as to reconsider the performance of randomized clinical trials. There have already been papers on the radiology preparedness that should be applied to radiology and nuclear medicine departments to support the care of patients with COVID-19 and maintain radiologic diagnostic and interventional support for the entirety of the hospital and healthcare system, particularly for emergencies, without jeopardizing an outbreak in the units. Since most nuclear medicine diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are non-urgent, the general guidance from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for infection prevention and control is to postpone scheduled procedure after cautious risk assessment, with certain exceptions. Individualized approach of each case is a sine qua non of ensuring low transmission of COVID-19 as well as effective and safe management of patients admitted to nuclear medicine departments. Another major issue raised is the possible impact COVID-19 on the transport of medical radioisotopes. By the 1(st) of April 2020, the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) co-chaired the European Observatory on Supply of Medical Radioisotope expressing their concerns related to the impact of COVID-19 on the supply chain and inconsequence on the availability of the most vital medical radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine. Due to the current lockdown situation, extended border controls, reductions and elimination of many commercial passenger flights, competition and cost of cargo and charter options, required appropriate additional support. The new era of nuclear medicine practice worldwide coincides with a new era for the Hellenic Society of Nuclear Medicine (HSNM) and the Hellenic Journal of Nuclear Medicine (HJNM). The founder and Editor in Chief for more than 28 consecutive years, Professor Emeritus Philip Grammaticos, resigned leaving behind a benchmark for the presidencies and editors to come.
