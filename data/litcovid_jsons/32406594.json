MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 166 COVID-19 patients at Tongji Hospital (Wuhan) from February 8 to March 21, 2020. Clinical characteristics and outcomes (as of April 4, 2020) were compared among control (group 1), secondary hyperglycaemia (group 2: no diabetes history, FPG levels >/=7.0 mmol/L once and HbA1c values <6.5%) and diabetic (group 3) patients. RESULTS: Compared to group 1, groups 2 and 3 had higher rates of leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, eosinopenia, and levels of sCRP, ferritin and d-dimer (P < 0.05 for all). Group 2 patients have higher levels of LDH, prevalence of liver dysfunction and increased IL-8 than those in group 1, a higher prevalence of increased IL-8 was found in group 2 than in group 3 (P < 0.05 for all).

The length of hospital stay did not differ between the two groups (21.0 days for metformin versus 19.5 days for no metformin, P = 0.74). However, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in the metformin group (3/104 (2.9%) versus 22/179 (12.3%), P = 0.01). Antidiabetic treatment with metformin was associated with decreased mortality compared with diabetics not receiving metformin. This retrospective analysis suggests that metformin may offer benefits in patients with COVID-19 and that further study is indicated."],"journal":"Am J Trop Med Hyg","authors":["Luo, Pan","Qiu, Lin","Liu, Yi","Liu, Xiu-Lan","Zheng, Jian-Ling","Xue, Hui-Ying","Liu, Wen-Hua","Liu, Dong","Li, Juan"],"date":"2020-05-25T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32446312","source":"PubMed","week":"202022|May 25 - May 31","doi":"10.4269/ajtmh.20-0375","locations":["Tongji Hospital","Wuhan","China","metformin"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Treatment"],"weight":1,"_version_":1667698385983897600,"score":255.85213}]}
