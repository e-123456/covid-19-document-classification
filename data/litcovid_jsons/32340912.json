KEY FINDINGS: The planning of a robust plan to prevent the transmission of the virus to patients and department staff members should be fundamental in each radiology service. Moreover, the speed of spread and the incidence of the pandemic make it necessary to optimize the use of personal protective devices and dedicated COVID-19 equipment, given the limited availability of supplies. CONCLUSION: In the management of radiographic and CT imaging, staff should take special precautions to limit contamination between patients and other patients or professionals. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: An isolated imaging room should be dedicated to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, including radiography and CT scanners.
