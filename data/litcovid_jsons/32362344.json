METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China. Eligible patients were adults (aged >/=18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2-10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days. Patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir-ritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first.

Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1.23 [95% CI 0.87-1.75]).

This study aimed to identify potential risk factors for mortality in older patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on admission, which may help identify those with poor prognosis at an early stage. DESIGN: Retrospective case-control. SETTING: Fever ward of Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Patients >/=60 years of age with COVID-19 (n = 244) were included, of which 123 were discharged and 121 died in hospital. MEASUREMENTS: Data retrieved from electronic medical records regarding symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings on admission, and final outcomes of all older patients with COVID-19, were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore risk factors for death. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that several clinical characteristics and laboratory variables were significantly different (i.e., p < .05) between discharged and deceased patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that lymphocyte (LYM) count (odds ratio [OR] 0.009 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.001-0.138]; p = .001) and older age (OR 1.1 22 [95% CI 1.007-1.249]; p = .037) were independently associated with hospital mortality. White blood cell count was also an important risk factor (p = .052). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the logistic regression model was 0.913. Risk factors for in-hospital death were similar between older men and women. CONCLUSION: Older age and lower LYM count on admission were associated with death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Stringent monitoring and early intervention are needed to reduce mortality in these patients. This article is protected by copyright.
