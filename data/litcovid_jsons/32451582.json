The virus subsequently spread worldwide, causing havoc to medical systems and paralyzing global economies. The first COVID-19 patient in Israel was diagnosed on 27 February 2020. OBJECTIVES: To present our findings and experiences as the first and largest center for COVID-19 patients in Israel. METHODS: The current analysis included all COVID-19 patients treated in Sheba Medical Center from February 2020 to April 2020. Clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological data gathered during their hospitalization are presented. RESULTS: Our 162 patient cohort included mostly adult (mean age of 52 +/- 20 years) males (65%). Patients classified as severe COVID-19 were significantly older and had higher prevalence of arterial hypertension and diabetes. They also had significantly higher white blood cell counts, absolute neutrophil counts, and lactate dehydrogenase. Low folic acid blood levels were more common amongst severe patients (18.2 vs. 12.9 vs. 9.8, P = 0.014). The rate of immune compromised patients (12%) in our cohort was also higher than in the general population. The rate of deterioration from moderate to severe disease was high: 9% necessitated non-invasive oxygenation and 15% were intubated and mechanically ventilated. The mortality rate was 3.1. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients present a challenge for healthcare professionals and the whole medical system. We hope our findings will assist other providers and institutions in their care for these patients.","Isr Med Assoc J","Itelman, Edward","Wasserstrum, Yishay","Segev, Amitai","Avaky, Chen","Negru, Liat","Cohen, Dor","Turpashvili, Natia","Anani, Sapir","Zilber, Eyal","Lasman, Nir","Athamna, Ahlam","Segal, Omer","Halevy, Tom","Sabiner, Yehuda","Donin, Yair","Abraham, Lital","Berdugo, Elisheva","Zarka, Adi","Greidinger, Dahlia","Agbaria, Muhamad","Kitany, Noor","Katorza, Eldad","Shenhav-Saltzman, Gilat","Segal, Gad","32378815"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: In February 2020, the World Health Organisation designated the name COVID-19 for a clinical condition caused by a virus identified as a cause for a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China.
