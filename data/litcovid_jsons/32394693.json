Initial reports suggesting the potential benefit of Hydroxychloroquine/Azithromycin (HY/AZ) have resulted in massive adoption of this combination worldwide. However, while the true efficacy of this regimen is unknown, initial reports have raised concerns regarding the potential risk of QT prolongation and induction of torsade de pointes (TdP). OBJECTIVE: to assess the change in QTc interval and arrhythmic events in patients with COVID-19 treated with HY/AZ METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 251 patients from two centers, diagnosed with COVID-19 and treated with HY/AZ. We reviewed ECG tracings from baseline and until 3 days after completion of therapy to determine the progression of QTc and incidence of arrhythmia and mortality. RESULTS: QTc prolonged in parallel with increasing drug exposure and incompletely shortened after its completion. Extreme new QTc prolongation to > 500 ms, a known marker of high risk for TdP had developed in 23% of patients. One patient developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) suspected as TdP, requiring emergent cardioversion. Seven patients required premature termination of therapy. The baseline QTc of patients exhibiting extreme QTc prolongation was normal. CONCLUSION: The combination of HY/AZ significantly prolongs the QTc in patients with COVID-19. This prolongation may be responsible for life threating arrhythmia in the form of TdP. This risk mandates careful consideration of HY/AZ therapy in lights of its unproven efficacy. Strict QTc monitoring should be performed if the regimen is given.","Heart Rhythm","Chorin, Ehud","Wadhwani, Lalit","Magnani, Silvia","Dai, Matthew","Shulman, Eric","Nadeau-Routhier, Charles","Knotts, Robert","Bar-Cohen, Roi","Kogan, Edward","Barbhaiya, Chirag","Aizer, Anthony","Holmes, Douglas","Bernstein, Scott","Spinelli, Michael","Park, David S","Stefano, Carugo","Chinitz, Larry A","Jankelson, Lior","32407884"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: There is no known effective therapy for patients with COVID-19.
