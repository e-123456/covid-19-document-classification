Since then, COVID-19 has become a global concern and health problem. METHODS: We present four patients in this study, selected from among patients who presented with pneumonia symptoms and were suspicious for COVID-19. They were referred to the intended centers for COVID-19 diagnosis and management of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in southern Iran. Two nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal throat swab samples were collected from each patient and tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using real-time reverse-transcriptase- polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). The samples were also tested for influenza viruses and the complete respiratory panel. RESULTS: In the present report, four patients were diagnosed in the starting days of COVID-19 disease in our center in southern Iran with co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. CONCLUSION: This co-infection of COVID-19 and influenza A highlights the importance of considering SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay regardless of other positive findings for other pathogens in the primary test during the epidemic.","Arch Iran Med","Khodamoradi, Zohre","Moghadami, Mohsen","Lotfi, Mehrzad","32271596"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: In late December 2019, a viral pneumonia known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated from China and spread very rapidly in the world.
