The primary aim of this review was to establish the incidence and timing of positive faecal samples for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature review identified studies describing COVID-19 patients tested for faecal virus. Search terms for Medline included 'clinical', 'faeces', 'gastrointestinal secretions', 'stool', 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2' and '2019-nCoV'. Additional searches were done in AJG, Gastroenterology, Gut, Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, The WHO Database, CEBM, NEJM, social media and the NICE, bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints. Data were extracted concerning the type of test, number and timing of positive samples, incidence of positive faecal tests after negative nasopharyngeal swabs and evidence of viable faecal virus or faeco-oral transmission of the virus. RESULTS: There were 26 relevant articles identified. Combining study results demonstrated that 53.9% of those tested for faecal RNA were positive. Duration of faecal viral shedding ranged from 1 to 33 days after a negative nasopharyngeal swab with one result remaining positive 47 days after onset of symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that COVID-19 is transmitted via faecally shed virus. CONCLUSION: There is a high rate of positive PCR tests with persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in faecal samples of patients with COVID-19. Further research is needed to confirm if this virus is viable and the degree of transmission through the faeco-oral route. This may have important implications on isolation, recommended precautions and protective equipment for interventional procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract.","Colorectal Dis","Gupta, S","Parker, J","Smits, S","Underwood, J","Dolwani, S","32418307"],"abstract":["AIM: In addition to respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 can present with gastrointestinal complaints suggesting possible faeco-oral transmission.

To analyse the clinical prognosis of discharged COVID-19 patients by monitoring their SAR-CoV-2 nucleic acid status, which may provide evidence to establish discharge standards and follow-up management for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We included 13 discharged COVID-19 patients who were quarantined for 4-week at home. The patient's daily clinical signs were recorded and sputum and faecal specimens were regularly sent for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. RESULTS: The time between initial symptoms and meeting discharge criteria was 18 - 44 days with an average of 25 +/- 6 days. The faecal samples of two patients still tested positive after meeting discharge criteria and the sputum samples of four patients returned positive 5 - 14 days after discharge. The rate of a recurring positive test result in samples from the respiratory system was 31%(4/13). CONCLUSION: Under the present discharge criteria, the high presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in faecal and respiratory samples of discharged COVID-19 patients indicate potential infectivity. Therefore, we suggest that faecal virus nucleic acid should be tested as a routine monitoring index for COVID-19 and a negative result be added to the criteria. Simultaneously, we should strengthen the regular follow-up of discharged patients with continuous monitoring of the recurrence of viral nucleic acid. This article is protected by copyright.
