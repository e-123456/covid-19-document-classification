Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax are uncommon complications of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Herein, we describe a fatal case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax. PATIENT CONCERNS: Subcutaneous emphysema was found in neck, bilateral chest walls, abdomen wall, groin area, and scrotum of a 67-year-old man. Extensive air-space opacities, subcutaneous emphysema and a small amount of pneumothorax were found in his chest X-ray scan. Echocardiography showed left ventricular enlargement with ejection fraction 20%. DIAGNOSIS: This resident of Wuhan with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection had chronic pulmonary and cardiac diseases. Liver dysfunction, myocardial injury, and coagulation disorder were suggested by laboratory findings. Pneumonia, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumothorax were confirmed with chest X-ray. Heart failure was revealed by echocardiography. INTERVENTIONS: He was transferred to intensive care unit, where invasive ventilation was used for him during the whole hospitalization. Prone position ventilation, vasoconstrictor, antibacteria, and antiviral therapy were given. OUTCOMES: He died on the twelfth day after admission. CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax may occur in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and chronic pulmonary disease. Chronic cardiac disease might be aggravated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and develop heart failure.","Medicine (Baltimore)","Xiang, Chunlin","Wu, Gang","32443345"],"abstract":["INTRODUCTION: Since the end of 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has affected more than 1,000,000 population in the world.
