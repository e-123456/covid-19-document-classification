Lower cellular redox status, which leads to pro-inflammatory states mediated by TNF-a is also potentially implicated.

NAC has also been shown to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway (IL1beta and IL18) in vitro, and decrease plasma TNF-a in human clinical trials. Mediation of the viral load could occur through NAC's ability to increase cellular redox status via maximizing the rate limiting step of glutathione synthesis, and thereby potentially decreasing the effects of virally induced oxidative stress and cell death.
