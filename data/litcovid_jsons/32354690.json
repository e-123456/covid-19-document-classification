Whenever herpes zoster leads to trigeminal involvement, the ophthalmic division is the most implicated. COVID-19 emerged as a viral cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome that spread all over the world in the last months. Co-infection with COVID and other viruses has been registered, but sparsely and embracing the respiratory ones. METHODS: report a case of a co-infection of COVID-19 with VZV, and review the literature. RESULTS: 39-year-old immunocompetent man with oligosymptomatic infection by COVID-19 evolved to left facial herpes zoster affecting the three divisions of trigeminal nerve. The co-infection was remotely registered with other respiratory virus, being influenza the most mentioned. However, the present case is associated to the emergence of a latent virus infection, which might be related to the viral inflammatory response, especially ascending from the nasal cavity, where trigeminal branches are also placed. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of the latent infection by VZV under a rare presentation might illustrate the impact at least locally of COVID-19, once retrograde reactivation of VZV was possibly induced in a young immunocompetent patient.","Eur J Neurol","de Freitas Ferreira, Ana Carolina Andorinho","Romao, Tayla Taynan","SIlva Macedo, Yuri","Pupe, Camila","Nascimento, Osvaldo Jm","32449248"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a human neurotropic virus that remains in a latent state within ganglionic neurons throughout the entire neuroaxis after the primary infection.
