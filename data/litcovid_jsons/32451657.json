METHODS: The survey was conducted among the members of the ISOLS (International Society of Limb Salvage) and the EMSOS (European Musculo-Skeletal Oncology Society). The survey consisted of 20 questions (single, multiple-response, ranked): origin and surgical experience of the participant (four questions), potential disruption of healthcare (12 questions), and influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the particular physician (four questions). A matrix with four different response options was created for the particular surgical procedures). RESULTS: One hundred forty-nine physicians from five continents completed the survey. Of the respondents, 20.1% and 20.7% stated that surgery for life-threatening sarcomas were stopped or delayed, respectively. Even when the malignancy was expected to involve infiltration of a neurovascular bundle or fracture of a bone, still 13.8% and 14.7% of the respondents, respectively, stated that surgery was not performed. In cases of pending fractures of bone tumors, 37.5 to 46.2% of operations were canceled. CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic caused a significant reduction in healthcare (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) for malignancies of the musculoskeletal system. Delaying or stopping these treatments is life-threatening or can cause severe morbidity, pain, and loss of function. Although the coronavirus disease causes severe medical complications, serious collateral damage including death due to delayed or untreated sarcomas should be avoided.","Int Orthop","Thaler, Martin","Khosravi, Ismail","Leithner, Andreas","Papagelopoulos, Panayiotis J","Ruggieri, Pietro","32451657"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on musculoskeletal tumor service by conducting an online survey of physicians.

METHODS: An online survey was performed of orthopaedic surgeons in the German-speaking Arthroscopy Society (Gesellschaft fur Arthroskopie und Gelenkchirurgie, AGA). The survey consisted of 20 questions concerning four topics: four questions addressed the origin and surgical experience of the participant, 12 questions dealt with potential cutbacks in orthopaedic healthcare and 4 questions addressed the influence of the pandemic on the particular surgeon.

Almost all surgical services have been reorganized, with the aim of maintaining an adequate therapeutic path, especially for surgical emergencies. The knowledge of how surgeons dealing with emergency surgery have reacted to the epidemic in the real life can be useful while drafting clinical recommendations. METHODS: Surgeons from multiple Italian regions were invited answering to an online survey in order to make a snapshot of their current behaviors towards COVID-19-positive patients bearing urgent surgical diseases. Questions about institutional rules and personal approach for patient treatment and to limit epidemic spread were included in a 37-item questionnaire. RESULTS: Seventy-one questionnaires from institutions dealing with emergency surgery were accepted. Participating surgeons were equally subdivided from a geographical point of view, with a large proportion of public (97.2%) and non-academical (91.5%) centers. In 80.3% of cases, the hospitals treated COVID-19 patients; in 69.1% of centers, a change in work plan was necessary, and 33.8% of teams had almost a surgeon infected or in preventive quarantine. The vast majority of surgeons operated only on urgent cases (73.9%), but the number of interventions significantly dropped. Up to 40% of non-traumatic abdominal emergency cases had an unusual delayed treatment. The laparoscopic approach was used in 69.6% of interventions on COVID-19 patients.

DISCUSSION: This survey confirms that the COVID-19 outbreak is dramatically changing the practice of emergency surgery centers in Italy.
