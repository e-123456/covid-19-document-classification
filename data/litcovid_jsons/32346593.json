CD4+ lymphocyte counts were 61, 180, and 348 cells/uL in severe-type patients, respectively. Notably, viral nucleic acid values in nasopharyngeal swabs were lower (19, 25, and 26) than those of ordinary-type patients, suggesting a higher viral load. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was also higher in severe-type patients CONCLUSIONS: Initial examination results of lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts and RT-PCR-CT values coupled with higher NLR may indicate the severity of COVID-19 infection for these family clusters."],"journal":"J Clin Virol","authors":["Xia, Xiao-Ying","Wu, Jing","Liu, He-Lei","Xia, Hong","Jia, Bei","Huang, Wen-Xiang"],"date":"2020-04-19T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32305025","week":"202016|Apr 13 - Apr 19","doi":"10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104360","keywords":["cd4+ counts","covid-19","neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio","rt-pcr-ct values","family aggregation"],"source":"PubMed","topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"locations":["Wuhan","Hubei","China","China","Western Chongqing","China","Chongqing","China","Wuhan"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"_version_":1664632934539198465,"score":278.1958}]}
