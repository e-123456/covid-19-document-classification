We found that an increased level of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, D-dimer, fibrinogen (FIB), IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), serum amyloid A (SAA) and a decreased level of lymphocytes were important risk factors associated with severity.
