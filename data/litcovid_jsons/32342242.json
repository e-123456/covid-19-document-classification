However, the precise timeline of the disease, its transmissibility, and the effect of mitigation strategies remain incompletely understood. Here we integrate a global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model to quantify the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States. For the outbreak in China, in [Formula: see text] provinces, we found a latent period of 2.56 +/- 0.72 days, a contact period of 1.47 +/- 0.32 days, and an infectious period of 17.82 +/- 2.95 days. We postulate that the latent and infectious periods are disease-specific, whereas the contact period is behavior-specific and can vary between different provinces, states, or countries. For the early stages of the outbreak in the United States, in [Formula: see text] states, we adopted the disease-specific values from China and found a contact period of 3.38 +/- 0.69 days. Our network model predicts that-without the massive political mitigation strategies that are in place today-the United States would have faced a basic reproduction number of 5.30 +/- 0.95 and a nationwide peak of the outbreak on May 10, 2020 with 3 million infections. Our results demonstrate how mathematical modeling can help estimate outbreak dynamics and provide decision guidelines for successful outbreak control. We anticipate that our model will become a valuable tool to estimate the potential of vaccination and quantify the effect of relaxing political measures including total lockdown, shelter in place, and travel restrictions for low-risk subgroups of the population or for the population as a whole.","Biomech Model Mechanobiol","Peirlinck, Mathias","Linka, Kevin","Sahli Costabal, Francisco","Kuhl, Ellen","32342242"],"abstract":["On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19, a global pandemic.

In the absence of evidence, individual communities had to take timely action to reduce the rate of disease spread and avoid overburdening their healthcare systems. Although a few predictive models have been published to guide these decisions, most have not taken into account spatial differences and have included assumptions that do not match the local realities. Access to reliable information that is adapted to local context is critical for policymakers to make informed decisions during a rapidly evolving pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop an adapted susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to predict the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina (NC) and the Charlotte metropolitan region and to incorporate the effect of a public health intervention to reduce disease spread, while accounting for unique regional features and imperfect detection. METHODS: Using the software package R, three SIR models were fit to infection prevalence data from the state and the greater Charlotte region and then rigorously compared. One of these models (SIR-Int) accounted for a stay-at-home intervention and imperfect detection of COVID-19 cases. We computed longitudinal total estimates of the susceptible, infected, and removed compartments of both populations, along with other pandemic characteristics (e.g., basic reproduction number). RESULTS: Prior to March 26, disease spread was rapid at the pandemic onset with the Charlotte region doubling time of 2.56 days (95% CI: (2.11, 3.25)) and in NC 2.94 days (95% CI: (2.33, 4.00)). Subsequently, disease spread significantly slowed with doubling times increased in the Charlotte region to 4.70 days (95% CI: (3.77, 6.22)) and in NC to 4.01 days (95% CI: (3.43, 4.83)). Reflecting spatial differences, this deceleration favored the greater Charlotte region compared to NC as a whole. A comparison of the efficacy of intervention, defined as 1 - the hazard ratio of infection, gave 0.25 for NC and 0.43 for the Charlotte region. Also, early in the pandemic, the initial basic SIR model had good fit to the data; however, as the pandemic and local conditions evolved, the SIR-Int model emerged as the model with better fit. CONCLUSIONS: Using local data and continuous attention to model adaptation, our findings have enabled policymakers, public health officials and health systems to proactively plan capacity and evaluate the impact of a public health intervention. Our SIR-Int model for estimated latent prevalence was reasonably flexible, highly accurate, and demonstrated the efficacy of a stay-at-home order at both the state and regional level.

RESULTS: Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.
