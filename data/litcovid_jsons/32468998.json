MATERIAL AND METHODS The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale were used to evaluate the resilience and perceived stress of 600 medical staff members from the radiology departments in 32 public hospitals in Sichuan Province, China, respectively. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze factors related to resilience. RESULTS The total resilience score was 65.76+/-17.26, wherein the toughness dimension score was 33.61+/-9.52, the strength dimension score was 21.25+/-5.50, and the optimism dimension score was 10.91+/-3.15. There was a significant negative correlation between perceived stress and resilience (r=-0.635, P<0.001). According to multivariate analysis, the total perceived stress score (ss=-1.318, P<0.001), gender (ss=-4.738, P<0.001), knowledge of COVID-19 (ss=2.884, P=0.043), knowledge of COVID-19 protective measures (ss=3.260, P=0.042), and availability of adequate protective materials (ss=-1.268, P=0.039) were independent influencing factors for resilience. CONCLUSIONS The resilience level of the medical staff in the radiology departments during the outbreak of COVID-19 was generally low, particularly regarding toughness. More attention should be paid to resilience influence factors such as high perceived stress, female gender, lack of understanding of COVID-19 and protective measures, and lack of protective materials, and targeted interventions should be undertaken to improve the resilience level of the medical staff in the radiology departments during the outbreak of COVID-19.","Med Sci Monit","Huang, Lei","Wang, Yun","Liu, Juan","Ye, Pengfei","Cheng, Bochao","Xu, Huayan","Qu, Haibo","Ning, Gang","32468998"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND A growing body of evidence suggests that in the face of life adversity, threats, or other major stressful events, resilience is more conducive to individual adaptation and growth.
