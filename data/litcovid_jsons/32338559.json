Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and hsa-miR-217 has been identified to mediate the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Aims: We performed this study to investigate the roles of hsa-miR-217, its target SIRT1, as well as P53/KAI1 axis in the brain metastasis from NSCLC. Study design: This is a cell culture study. Methods: Human pulmonary adenocarcinoma brain metastasis cell line PC-14/B were incubated and treated with constructed lentiviral plasmids expressing miR-217 and/or SIRT1. BEAS-2B cell line was used as a control. The targeted regulation of miR-217 to SIRT1 was examined using dual luciferase reporter assay. Cell proliferation, migration, invasion and the expression of relate proteins were detected to examine the effect of miR-217/SIRT1 expression on metastasis. Results: PC-14/B cells expressed higher SIRT1 and lower p53 and KAI1 compared with BEAS-2B control cells (P<0.05). SIRT1 was a direct target of miR-217. MiR-217 expression suppressed PC-14/B cell invasion (P=0.004), migration (P=0.001) and proliferation (P<0.05), whereas SIRT1 overexpression reversed all processes. SIRT1 expression inhibited P53, KAI1/CD82, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and beta-catenin but upregulated E-cadherin protein. MiR-217 overexpression induced reverse changes. Conclusions: Hsa-miR-217 and its target SIRT1 acted as metastasis suppressor and promoter gene in NSCLC, respectively. The hsa-miR-217/SIRT1/P53/KAI1 metastasis regulatory pathway showed novel and crucial roles in brain metastasis from NSCLC. This axis might be a potential target for the treatment of brain metastasis of lung cancer.","Balkan Med J","Jiang, Wenxia","Hou, Likun","Wei, Juan","Du, Yifeng","Zhao, Yan","Deng, Xue","Lin, Xiangdong","32267139"],"abstract":["Background: Brain metastasis is a major cause for cancer death in patients with lung cancer.

Recent pediatric data suggest that existing WHO dosing guidelines for children with malaria are suboptimal. The aim of our study was to establish best-evidence to inform pediatric CHQ doses for children infected with COVID-19. A previously developed physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for CHQ was used to simulate exposure in adults and children and verified against published pharmacokinetic data. The COVID-19 recommended adult dosage regimen of 44mg/kg total was tested in adults and children to evaluate the extent of variation in exposure. Based on differences in AUC0-70h the optimal CHQ dose was determined in children of different ages compared to adults. Revised doses were re-introduced into the model to verify that overall CHQ exposure in each age band was within 5% of the predicted adult value. Simulations showed differences in drug exposure in children of different ages and adults when the same body-weight based dose is given. As such, we propose the following total cumulative doses: 35 mg/kg (CHQ base) for children 0-1 month, 47 mg/kg for 1-6 months, 55 mg/kg for 6 months-12 years and 44 mg/kg for adolescents and adults, not to exceed 3300 mg in any patient. Our study supports age-adjusted CHQ dosing in children with COVID-19 in order to avoid suboptimal or toxic doses.
