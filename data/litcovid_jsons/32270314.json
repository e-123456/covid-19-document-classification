Purpose To assess the performance of United States (U.S.) and Chinese radiologists in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT. Methods A total of 219 patients with both positive COVID-19 by RT-PCR and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from 7 Chinese hospitals in Hunan Providence, China from January 6 to February 20, 2020. A total of 205 patients with positive Respiratory Pathogen Panel for viral pneumonia and CT findings consistent with or highly suspicious for pneumonia by original radiology interpretation within 7 days of each other were identified from Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, RI. Three Chinese radiologists blindly reviewed all chest CTs (n=424) to differentiate COVID-19 from viral pneumonia. A sample of 58 age-matched cases was randomly selected and evaluated by 4 U.S. radiologists in a similar fashion. Different CT features were recorded and compared between the two groups. Results For all chest CTs, three Chinese radiologists correctly differentiated COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia 83% (350/424), 80% (338/424), and 60% (255/424) of the time, respectively. The seven radiologists had sensitivities of 80%, 67%, 97%, 93%, 83%, 73% and 70% and specificities of 100%, 93%, 7%, 100%, 93%, 93%, 100%. Compared to non-COVID-19 pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia was more likely to have a peripheral distribution (80% vs. 57%, p<0.001), ground-glass opacity (91% vs. 68%, p<0.001), fine reticular opacity (56% vs. 22%, p<0.001), and vascular thickening (59% vs. 22%, p<0.001), but less likely to have a central+peripheral distribution (14.% vs. 35%, p<0.001), pleural effusion (4.1 vs. 39%, p<0.001) and lymphadenopathy (2.7% vs. 10.2%, p<0.001).
