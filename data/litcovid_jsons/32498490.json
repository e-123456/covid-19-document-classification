In Korea, COVID-19 screening guidelines have been established in each hospital, trying to prevent the spread of infection. A case of successful Cesarean section from confirmed mother has been reported, but there are no guidelines for suspected mothers. Cesarean section can be operated urgently without sufficient evaluations of the infection. Case: Our hospital, located in Daegu, Korea, was designated as quarantine and delivery facility for suspected mother, and Cesarean section was done to seven suspected mothers and one confirmed mother. Conclusions: This case report suggests the guideline for infection control of surgery and anesthesia in emergent cesarean section of COVID-19 suspected mother by preparing operating room and protection strategy.","Korean J Anesthesiol","Oh, Jeongmin","Kim, Eunju","Kim, Hyunkyum","Lee, Sang-Ah","Lee, Kyeong Hee","Yu, Mi Hyae","An, Jihyun","32498490"],"abstract":["Background: Since the Coronavirus diseases-19 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China, Korea has also been exposed to the virus.
