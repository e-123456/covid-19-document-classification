The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. Objective: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. Exposures: Documented NCIP. Main Outcomes and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. Results: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 x 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation).

In severe novel coronavirus pneumonia cases, the number of platelets, their dynamic changes during the treatment, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio(PLR)were a concern. We sought to describe platelet feature of these cases. METHODS: Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed Corona Virus Disease(COVID)-19 in Huizhou municipal central hospitalfrom January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively analysed. Demographic, clinical, blood routine results, other laborotary results and treatment date were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of severe patients and non-severe patients were compared. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that: age, platelet peaks and PLR at peak platelet were the influencing factors in severe patients,multivariate analysis showed that the PLR value at peak platelet during treatment was an independent influencing factor in severe patients.The average hospitalization day of patients with platelet peaks during treatment were longer than those without platelet peaks(P<0.05).The average age of patients with platelet peaks during treatment were older than those without platelet peaks(P<0.05). The patients with significantly elevated platelets during treatment had longer average hospitalization day. And the higher PLR of patients during treatment had longer average hospitalization day. CONCLUSION: Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Huizhou municipal central hospital, presumed that the number of platelets and their dynamic changes during the treatment may have suggestion on the severity and prognosis of disease. The patient with markedly elevated platelets and longer average hospitalization day may be related to the cytokine storm. The PLR of patients means the degree of cytokine storm, which might provide a new indicator in the monitoring in patients with COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

In severe novel coronavirus pneumonia cases, the number of platelets, their dynamic changes during the treatment, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio(PLR)were a concern. We sought to describe platelet feature of these cases. METHODS: Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed Corona Virus Disease(COVID)-19 in Huizhou municipal central hospitalfrom January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively analysed. Demographic, clinical, blood routine results, other laborotary results and treatment date were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of severe patients and non-severe patients were compared. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that: age, platelet peaks and PLR at peak platelet were the influencing factors in severe patients,multivariate analysis showed that the PLR value at peak platelet during treatment was an independent influencing factor in severe patients.The average hospitalization day of patients with platelet peaks during treatment were longer than those without platelet peaks(P<0.05).The average age of patients with platelet peaks during treatment were older than those without platelet peaks(P<0.05). The patients with significantly elevated platelets during treatment had longer average hospitalization day. And the higher PLR of patients during treatment had longer average hospitalization day. CONCLUSION: Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Huizhou municipal central hospital, presumed that the number of platelets and their dynamic changes during the treatment may have suggestion on the severity and prognosis of disease. The patient with markedly elevated platelets and longer average hospitalization day may be related to the cytokine storm. The PLR of patients means the degree of cytokine storm, which might provide a new indicator in the monitoring in patients with COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.
