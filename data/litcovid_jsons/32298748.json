This study aimed to synthesise evidence for the role and response of palliative care and hospice teams to viral epi/pandemics, to inform the COVID-19 pandemic response. We conducted a rapid systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines in five databases. Of 3094 papers identified, ten were included in this narrative synthesis. Included studies were from West Africa, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the United States and Italy. All had an observational design. Findings were synthesised using a previously proposed framework according to 'systems' (policies, training and protocols, communication and coordination, data), 'staff' (deployment, skill mix, resilience), 'space' (community provision, use of technology) and 'stuff' (medicines and equipment, personal protective equipment). We conclude that hospice and palliative services have an essential role in the response to COVID-19 by: 1) responding rapidly and flexibly; 2) ensuring protocols for symptom management are available, and training non-specialists in their use; 3) being involved in triage; 4) considering shifting resources into the community; 5) considering redeploying volunteers to provide psychosocial and bereavement care; 6) facilitating camaraderie among staff and adopt measures to deal with stress; 7) using technology to communicate with patients and carers; 8) adopting standardised data collection systems to inform operational changes and improve care.","J Pain Symptom Manage","Etkind, Simon N","Bone, Anna E","Lovell, Natasha","Cripps, Rachel L","Harding, Richard","Higginson, Irene J","Sleeman, Katherine E","32278097"],"abstract":["Cases of COVID-19 are escalating rapidly across the globe, with the mortality risk being especially high among those with existing illness and multimorbidity.

Medical providers, teams, and organizations have needed to shift their visits away from face-to-face visits and toward telehealth (both by phone and through video). Palliative care teams who practice in the community setting are faced with a difficult task: How do we actively triage the most urgent visits while keeping our vulnerable patients safe from the pandemic? MEASURES: The following are recommendations created by the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Palliative Care and Support Services team to help triage and coordinate for timely, safe, and effective palliative care in the community and outpatient setting during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Patients are initially triaged based on location followed by acuity. Interdisciplinary care is implemented using strict infection control guidelines in the setting of limited personal protective equipment (PPE) resources. We implement thorough screening for COVID-19 symptoms at multiple levels before a patient is seen by a designated provider. CONCLUSIONS/LESSONS LEARNED: We recommend active triaging, communication, frequent screening for COVID-19 symptoms for palliative care patients been evaluated in the community setting.
