CASE DESCRIPTION: We present two patients with covid-19 and concurrent neurological symptoms. Our first patient is a 31-year-old man who had flu-like symptoms due to covid-19 and later developed an acute-onset severe headache and loss of consciousness and was diagnosed with a Hunt and Hess grade 3 subarachnoid haemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm. Our second patient is a 62-year-old woman who had an ischaemic stroke with massive haemorrhagic conversion requiring a decompressive hemicraniectomy. Both patients' CSF was repeatedly negative on real-time PCR analysis despite concurrent neurological disease. CONCLUSION: Our report shows that patients' CSF may be devoid of viral particles even when they test positive for covid-19 on a nasal swab. Whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in CSF may depend on the systemic disease severity and the degree of the virus' nervous tissue tropism and should be examined in future studies.","J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry","Al Saiegh, Fadi","Ghosh, Ritam","Leibold, Adam","Avery, Michael B","Schmidt, Richard F","Theofanis, Thana","Mouchtouris, Nikolaos","Philipp, Lucas","Peiper, Stephen C","Wang, Zi-Xuan","Rincon, Fred","Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula I","Jabbour, Pascal","Rosenwasser, Robert H","Gooch, M Reid","32354770"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Emergence of the novel corona virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2) in December 2019 has led to the covid-19 pandemic.

The resulting skull base defect was repaired using a pedicled nasoseptal flap (NSF).
