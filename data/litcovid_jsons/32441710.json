REVIEW METHODS: Incorporating available evidence and the projected infection control and resource limitations at our institution, we collectively authored a dynamic set of protocols guiding (1) case stratification, (2) preoperative assessment, (3) operative setup, and (4) postoperative care of patients with sinus or skull base presentations. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of COVID-19 publications, lack of rigorous data, and urgent necessity of standardized protocols, strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were not employed. CONCLUSIONS: As scarce hospital resources are diverted to COVID-19 care and staff are redeployed to forward-facing roles, endonasal procedures have largely ceased, leaving patients with ongoing sinonasal and skull base complaints untreated. Skull base teams now weigh the urgency of surgery in this population with the regional availability of resources.
