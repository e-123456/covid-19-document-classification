OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to find out the effects of social media on spreading panic of COVID-19, and its impact on mental health in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. METHODS: To carry out this study, an online questionnaire was prepared to conduct in Iraqi Kurdistan, and total number of 516 social media users were sampled. The present study deployed a content analysis method for the data analysis. Correspondingly, the data was analysed through SPSS version 25 and presented in tabulation and figures. RESULTS: The study determined that social media has a significant impact spreading fears and panic of the COVID-19 outbreaks in Iraqi Kurdistan Region.
