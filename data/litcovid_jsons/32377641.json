The aim was to examine demographic and clinical factors associated with COVID-19 hospitalisation status in people with rheumatic disease. METHODS: Case series of individuals with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry: 24 March 2020 to 20 April 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs of hospitalisation. Age, sex, smoking status, rheumatic disease diagnosis, comorbidities and rheumatic disease medications taken immediately prior to infection were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 600 cases from 40 countries were included. Nearly half of the cases were hospitalised (277, 46%) and 55 (9%) died. In multivariable-adjusted models, prednisone dose >/=10 mg/day was associated with higher odds of hospitalisation (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.96). Use of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) alone or in combination with biologics/Janus Kinase inhibitors was not associated with hospitalisation (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.17 and OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.46, respectively). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was not associated with hospitalisation status (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.06). Tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (anti-TNF) use was associated with a reduced odds of hospitalisation (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.81), while no association with antimalarial use (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.57) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: We found that glucocorticoid exposure of >/=10 mg/day is associated with a higher odds of hospitalisation and anti-TNF with a decreased odds of hospitalisation in patients with rheumatic disease. Neither exposure to DMARDs nor NSAIDs were associated with increased odds of hospitalisation.","Ann Rheum Dis","Gianfrancesco, Milena","Hyrich, Kimme L","Al-Adely, Sarah","Carmona, Loreto","Danila, Maria I","Gossec, Laure","Izadi, Zara","Jacobsohn, Lindsay","Katz, Patricia","Lawson-Tovey, Saskia","Mateus, Elsa F","Rush, Stephanie","Schmajuk, Gabriela","Simard, Julia","Strangfeld, Anja","Trupin, Laura","Wysham, Katherine D","Bhana, Suleman","Costello, Wendy","Grainger, Rebecca","Hausmann, Jonathan S","Liew, Jean W","Sirotich, Emily","Sufka, Paul","Wallace, Zachary S","Yazdany, Jinoos","Machado, Pedro M","Robinson, Philip C","32471903"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 outcomes in people with rheumatic diseases remain poorly understood.
