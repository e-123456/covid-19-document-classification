RESULTS: The consensus exercise was completed by 339 individuals from 41 countries (64% UK). Consensus was reached on 71/100 statements, predominantly standardisation of OR pathways, OR staffing, and pre-operative screening or diagnosis. The highest levels of consensus were observed in statements relating to appropriate personal and protective equipment (PPE) and risk distribution (96-99%), clear consent processes (96%), multidisciplinary decision-making and working (97%).
