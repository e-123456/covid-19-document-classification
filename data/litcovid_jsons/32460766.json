One effective and complementary strategy to slow the spread and reduce the impact is to trace the primary and secondary contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases using contact tracing technology.

METHODS: We conducted an exploratory review of current measures for COVID-19 contact tracing implemented around the world. We then analyzed how countries are using mobile positioning data technology to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We made recommendations on how Nigeria can adopt this approach while adhering to the guidelines provided by the National Data Protection Regulation (NDPR). RESULTS: Despite the potential of digital contact tracing, it always conflicts with patient data privacy regulations. We found that Nigeria's response complies with the NDPR, and that it is possible to leverage call detail records to complement current strategies within the NDPR.
