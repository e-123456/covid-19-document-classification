The serology characteristics and complement diagnosis value of the antibody test to RNA test need to be demonstrated. METHOD: Serial sera of 80 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, China. Total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected, and the antibody dynamics during the infection were described. RESULTS: The seroconversion rates for Ab, IgM and IgG were 98.8%, 93.8% and 93.8%, respectively. The first detectible serology marker was Ab, followed by IgM and IgG, with a median seroconversion time of 15, 18 and 20 days post exposure (d.p.e) or 9, 10 and 12 days post onset (d.p.o), respectively. The antibody levels increased rapidly beginning at 6 d.p.o. and were accompanied by a decline in viral load.
