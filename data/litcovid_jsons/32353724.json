Daily data as well as data on SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 mortality obtained between December 1, 2019 and March 28, 2020 were collected from weather stations around the world.

Daily data by country were analyzed using the panel data model. An increase in the average daily temperature by one degree Fahrenheit reduced the number of cases by approximately 6.4 cases/day. There was a negative correlation between the average temperature per country and the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections. This association remained strong even with the incorporation of additional variables and controls (maximum temperature, average temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation) and fixed country effects. There was a positive correlation between precipitation and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Countries with higher rainfall measurements showed an increase in disease transmission. For each average inch/day, there was an increase of 56.01 cases/day.

We analyzed case-data from the United States to investigate effects of temperature, precipitation, and UV Light on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Daily reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 across the United States from 01/22/2020 to 04/03/2020 were analyzed. We used negative binomial regression modelling to investigate whether daily maximum temperature, precipitation, UV Index and the incidence 5 days later were related. We performed sensitivity analyses at 3 days, 7 days and 9 days to assess transmission lags. RESULTS: A maximum temperature greater than 52 degrees F on a given day was associated with a lower rate of new cases at 5 days[IRR: 0.85(0.76,0.96)p=0.009]. Among observations with daily temperatures below 52 degrees F, there was a significant inverse association between the maximum daily temperature and the rate of cases at 5 days [IRR 0.98(0.97,0.99)p=0.001]. The rate of new cases was predicted to be lower for theoretical states that maintained a stable maximum daily temperature above 52 degrees F with a predicted 23-fewer cases per-million per-day by 25 days of the epidemic. A 1-unit higher UV index was associated with a lower rate at 5 days [IRR 0.97(0.95,0.99)p=0.004]. Precipitation was not associated with a greater rate of cases at 5 days [IRR 0.98(0.89,1.08)p=0.65].
