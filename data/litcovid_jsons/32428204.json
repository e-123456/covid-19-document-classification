METHODS: This retrospective single-center study consecutively enrolled patients who presented with STEMI and scheduled for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) during the outbreak of COVID- 19. Due to the delay in the reporting of the PCR test results, our postprocedural triage regarding COVID-19, followed by the isolation strategy, was based on lung CT scan results. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients with STEMI referred to our center. PPCI was done for 44 (91%) of these patients. The mean symptom-to-device time was 490.93 +/- 454.608 minutes, and the mean FMC-to-device time was and 154.12 +/- 36.27 minutes. Nine (18%) patients with STEMI were diagnosed as having typical/indeterminate features indicating COVID-19 involvement. During hospitalization, 1 (2.0%) patient died of cardiogenic shock.
