Mild illness has been reported, but whether illness severity correlates with infectivity is unknown. We describe the public health investigation of a mildly ill, non-hospitalized COVID-19 case who traveled to China. METHODS: The case was a Maricopa County resident with multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive specimens collected on January 22, 2020. Contacts were persons exposed to the case on or after the day before case diagnostic specimen collection. Contacts were monitored for 14 days after last known exposure. High-risk contacts had close, prolonged case contact (>/=10 minutes within 2 meters). Medium-risk contacts wore all U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended personal protective equipment during interactions. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens were collected from the case and high-risk contacts and tested for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Paired case NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing at 11 time points. In 8 pairs (73%), >/=1 specimen tested positive or indeterminate, and in 3 pairs (27%) both tested negative. Specimens collected 18 days after diagnosis tested positive. Sixteen contacts were identified; 11 (69%) had high-risk exposure, including 1 intimate contact, and 5 (31%) had medium-risk exposure. In total, 35 high-risk contact NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing; all 35 pairs (100%) tested negative. CONCLUSIONS: This report demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause mild illness and result in positive tests for up to 18 days after diagnosis, without evidence of transmission to close contacts. These data might inform public health strategies to manage individuals with asymptomatic infection or mild illness.","Clin Infect Dis","Scott, Sarah E","Zabel, Karen","Collins, Jennifer","Hobbs, Katherine C","Kretschmer, Melissa J","Lach, Mitchell","Turnbow, Katie","Speck, Lindsay","White, Jessica R","Maldonado, Keila","Howard, Brandon","Fowler, Jeanene","Singh, Sonia","Robinson, Susan","Pompa, Alexandra Peterson","Chatham-Stephens, Kevin","Xie, Amy","Cates, Jordan","Lindstrom, Stephen","Lu, Xiaoyan","Rolfes, Melissa A","Flanagan, Marcy","Sunenshine, Rebecca","32240285"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a range of illness severity.

As of February 23, 2020, there were 76,936 reported cases in mainland China and 1,875 cases in locations outside mainland China (1). There have been 2,462 associated deaths worldwide; no deaths have been reported in the United States. Fourteen cases have been diagnosed in the United States, and an additional 39 cases have occurred among repatriated persons from high-risk settings, for a current total of 53 cases within the United States. This report summarizes the aggressive measures (2,3) that CDC, state and local health departments, multiple other federal agencies, and other partners are implementing to slow and try to contain transmission of COVID-19 in the United States. These measures require the identification of cases and contacts of persons with COVID-19 in the United States and the recommended assessment, monitoring, and care of travelers arriving from areas with substantial COVID-19 transmission. Although these measures might not prevent widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare state and local health departments, health care systems, businesses, educational organizations, and the general public in the event that widespread transmission occurs; and 3) better characterize COVID-19 to guide public health recommendations and the development and deployment of medical countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. U.S. public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely, and CDC is coordinating efforts with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other global partners. Interim guidance is available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html. As more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by CDC, state and local health departments, health care providers, and communities."],"journal":"MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep","authors":["Jernigan, Daniel B"],"date":"2020-02-28T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32106216","week":"20209|Feb 24 - Mar 01","doi":"10.15585/mmwr.mm6908e1","source":"PubMed","locations":["China","Wuhan","United States","Hubei","USA"],"countries":["China","United States"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China","USA|United States"],"topics":["Prevention"],"weight":1,"_version_":1662334544226811904,"score":257.79288}]}
