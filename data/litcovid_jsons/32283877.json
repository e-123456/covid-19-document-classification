Patients with cardiac injury had higher mortality than those without cardiac injury (42 of 82 [51.2%] vs 15 of 334 [4.5%]; P < .001). In a Cox regression model, patients with vs those without cardiac injury were at a higher risk of death, both during the time from symptom onset (hazard ratio, 4.26 [95% CI, 1.92-9.49]) and from admission to end point (hazard ratio, 3.41 [95% CI, 1.62-7.16]).

Data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 are limited. OBJECTIVE: The severity on admission, complications, treatment, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients were evaluated. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020 to February 5, 2020 were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020. Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients. RESULTS: We identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission. Elder age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a), and high LDH level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission. The prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 patients was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan. The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period. Survival analysis revealed that male, elder age, leukocytosis, high LDH level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with elder age, hypertension, and high LDH level need careful observation and early intervention to prevent the potential development of severe COVID-19. Severe male patients with heart injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use may have high risk of death.","J Allergy Clin Immunol","Li, Xiaochen","Xu, Shuyun","Yu, Muqing","Wang, Ke","Tao, Yu","Zhou, Ying","Shi, Jing","Zhou, Min","Wu, Bo","Yang, Zhenyu","Zhang, Cong","Yue, Junqing","Zhang, Zhiguo","Renz, Harald","Liu, Xiansheng","Xie, Jungang","Xie, Min","Zhao, Jianping","32294485"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: In December 2019, COVID-19 outbreak occurred in Wuhan.
