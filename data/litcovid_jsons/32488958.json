METHODS: One hundred and sixty one consecutive severe and critical COVID-19 patients admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) were retrospectively reviewed in this multicenter study. Demographic features, medical histories, clinical symptoms, lung computerized tomography (CT) findings, and laboratory indexes on admission were collected. Post-admission complications, treatment regimens, and clinical outcomes were also documented. RESULTS: The mean age was 59.38 +/- 16.54 years, with 104 (64.60%) males and 57 (35.40%) females. Hypertension (44 [27.33%]) and diabetes were the most common medical histories. Fever (127 [78.88%]) and dry cough (111 [68.94%]) were the most common symptoms. Blood routine indexes, hepatic and renal function indexes, and inflammation indexes were commonly abnormal. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was the most common post-admission complication (69 [42.86%]), followed by electrolyte disorders (48 [29.81%]), multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) (37 [22.98%]), and hypoproteinemia (36 [22.36%]). The most commonly used antiviral drug was lopinavir/ritonavir tablet. 50 (31.06%) patients died, while 78 (48.45%) patients healed and discharged, and the last 33 (20.50%) patients remained in hospital. Besides, the mean hospital stay of deaths was 21.66 +/- 11.18 days, while the mean hospital stay of discharged patients was 18.42 +/- 12.77 days.
