However, the impact of digestive system diseases have not been issued. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD) on hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We extracted clinical data regarding 95 patients in Jin-yin tan hospital, Wuhan, China between January 26(th) , 2020 and February 21(st) . The Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) was used to assess the presence and severity of LPRD. A RSI >13 is considered to be abnormal. RESULTS: A total of 95 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled, with 61.1% (58/95), 32.6% (31/95), and 6.3% (6/95) being moderately ill, severely ill, and critically ill, respectively. In this study, 38.9% (37/95) of the patient had a RSI score over 13, which was indicative of LPRD. In a univariable analysis, the age and RSI scores of severely or critically ill patients were statistically significantly higher than patients with moderate disease (p=0.026 and p=0.005, respectively). After controlling for age difference in a multivariable model, the RSI>13, compared with RSI=0, was associated with significantly higher risk of severe infection (p<0.001; OR = 11.411, 95% CI 2.95-42.09) and critical infection (p=0.028; OR = 19.61, 95% CI 1.38-277.99). CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, RSI score greater than 13, indicative of LPRD, correlated with poorer clinical outcomes. The prevalence of LPRD may be higher than the general population, which indicated that COVID-19 can impair the upper esophageal sphincter and aggravate reflux. This article is protected by copyright.
