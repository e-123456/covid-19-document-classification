We briefly introduce the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea, scrutinize gendered vulnerability in contracting the virus, and then analyze the gendered aspects of the pandemic response in two phases: quarantine policy and mitigation policy. The authors elicit four lessons from the analysis. First, gender needs to be mainstreamed at all stages of a public health emergency response. Second, in addition to medical care, all formal and informal care work should be considered as an essential component of health care systems. Third, a people-centered approach in health governance should be prioritized to make women's voices heard at every level. Fourth, medical technology and resources to cope with pandemic should be produced and distributed in an equitable manner, acknowledging differential vulnerability and susceptibility.","Health Educ Behav","Kim, Saerom","Kim, Jin-Hwan","Park, Yukyung","Kim, Sun","Kim, Chang-Yup","32443944"],"abstract":["This study aims to analyze South Korea's experience during the COVID-19 outbreak through a gendered lens.
