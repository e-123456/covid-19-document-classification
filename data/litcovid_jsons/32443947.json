Telemedicine and digital medicine also offer critically important approaches to improve access, efficacy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of medical care for people with diabetes. Methods: Two case reports are presented where telemedicine was used effectively and safely after day 1 in person patient education. These aspects of the management of new-onset T1D patients (adult and pediatric) included ongoing diabetes education of the patient and family digitally. The patients used continuous glucose monitoring with commercially available analysis software (Dexcom Clarity and Glooko) to generate ambulatory glucose profiles and interpretive summary reports. The adult subject used multiple daily insulin injections; the pediatric patient used an insulin pump. The subjects were managed using a combination of e-mail, Internet via Zoom, and telephone calls. Results: These two cases show the feasibility and effectiveness of use of telemedicine in applications in which we had not used it previously: new-onset diabetes education and insulin dosage management. Conclusions: The present case reports illustrate how telemedicine can be used safely and effectively for new-onset T1D training and education for both pediatric and adult patients and their families. The COVID-19 pandemic has acutely stimulated the expansion of the use of telemedicine and digital medicine. We conclude that telemedicine is an effective approach for the management of patients with new-onset T1D.","Diabetes Technol Ther","Garg, Satish K","Rodbard, David","Hirsch, Irl B","Forlenza, Gregory P","32302499"],"abstract":["Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic provides an incentive to expand considerably the use of telemedicine for high-risk patients with diabetes, and especially for the management of type 1 diabetes (T1D).

We report our experience with two patients providing diabetes care effectively and preventing hospital admissions by using telehealth. Methods: Two adult patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D): one new onset and the other one with established T1D are presented where telehealth facilitated by Clarity Software and the \"Share\" feature with the use of Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for management of diabetic ketosis and hyperglycemia. Results: Both patients were managed effectively virtually despite higher risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Shared glucose data through CGM facilitated frequent insulin dose adjustments, increased fluid and carbohydrate intake, and prevented hospital admissions in both cases. In the case of new onset patient with T1D, most of the education was done remotely by certified diabetes care and education specialists. Conclusion: Acute diabetes complication like DKA increases morbidity and mortality in addition to adding cost to the health care system. The current pandemic of COVID-19 has allowed newer ways (with the help of newer technologies) to manage high-risk patients with T1D and DKA through telehealth and may result in lasting benefits to people with T1D.","Diabetes Technol Ther","Peters, Anne L","Garg, Satish","32383989"],"abstract":["Background: The Stay at Home order in Colorado and The Stay Safe at Home order in California during COVID-19 pandemic have forced a majority of the endocrinologists/diabetologists to adapt to providing diabetes care remotely through telehealth.
