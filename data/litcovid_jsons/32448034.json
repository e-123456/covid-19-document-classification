We calculated the total binding free energy (DeltaGbind) of both inhibitors and further decomposed DeltaGbind into various forces governing the complex formation using the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) method. Our calculations reveal that alpha-ketoamide is more potent (DeltaGbind= - 9.05 kcal/mol) compared to Z31792168 (DeltaGbind= - 3.25 kcal/mol) against COVID-19 3CL(pro). The increase in DeltaGbind for alpha-ketoamide relative to Z31792168 arises due to an increase in the favorable electrostatic and van der Waals interactions between the inhibitor and 3CL(pro). Further, we have identified important residues controlling the 3CL(pro)-ligand binding from per-residue based decomposition of the binding free energy. Finally, we have compared DeltaGbind of these two inhibitors with the anti-HIV retroviral drugs, such as lopinavir and darunavir. It is observed that alpha-ketoamide is more potent compared to lopinavir and darunavir. In the case of lopinavir, a decrease in van der Waals interactions is responsible for the lower binding affinity compared to alpha-ketoamide.
