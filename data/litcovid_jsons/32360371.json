The degree of hypercoagulability appears to correlate with outcomes, however optimal criteria to assess for the highest risk patients for thrombotic events remain unclear; we hypothesized that deranged thromboelastography (TEG) measurements of coagulation would correlate with thromboembolic events. METHODS: Patients admitted to an intensive care unit with COVID-19 diagnoses that had TEG analyses performed were studied. Conventional coagulation assays, D-dimer levels, and viscoelastic parameters were analyzed using a receiver operating characteristic curve to predict thromboembolic outcomes and new onset renal failure. RESULTS: Forty-four patients with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Derangements in coagulation laboratory values including elevated D-Dimer, fibrinogen, PT, and PTT were confirmed; viscoelastic parameters showed an elevated maximum amplitude and low lysis at 30 minutes. A complete lack of lysis of clot at 30 minutes was seen in 57% of patients and predicted VTE with an AUROC of .742 (p=0.021). A D-Dimer cutoff of 2600 ng/ml predicted need for dialysis with an AUROC of .779 (p=0.005). Overall, patients with no lysis of clot at 30 minutes and a D-Dimer of greater than 2600 ng/ml had a rate of VTE of 50% compared to 0% for patients with neither risk factor (p=0.008) and had a hemodialysis rate of 80% compared to 14% (p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Fibrinolysis shutdown, as evidenced by elevated D-Dimer and complete failure of clot lysis at 30 minutes on thromboelastography, predicts thromboembolic events and need for hemodialysis in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Further clinical trials are required to ascertain the need for early therapeutic anticoagulation or fibrinolytic therapy to address this state of fibrinolysis shutdown.","J Am Coll Surg","Wright, Franklin L","Vogler, Thomas O","Moore, Ernest E","Moore, Hunter B","Wohlauer, Max V","Urban, Shane","Nydam, Trevor L","Moore, Peter K","McIntyre, Robert C Jr","32422349"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predisposes patients to a prothrombotic state with demonstrated microvascular involvement.
