Long-term treatment is associated with a small increase in the risk of herpes virus reactivation and respiratory tract infections. Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) under Fingolimod treatment have not been described. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report a 57-year old female patient with a relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis under fingolimod treatment who experienced a severe COVID-19 infection in March 2020 (Extended Disability Status Scale: 2.0). Having peripheral lymphopenia typical for fingolimod treatment (total lymphocytes 0.39/nL [reference range 1.22-3.56]), the patient developed bilateral interstitial pneumonia with multiple ground-glass opacities on chest CT. Fingolimod medication was stopped. On the intensive care unit, non-invasive ventilation was used to provide oxygen and ventilation support regularly. Over the following two days, oxygenation improved, and the patient was transferred to a normal ward five days after admission. CONCLUSION: The implications fingolimod has on COVID-19 are complex. As an S1P analogue, fingolimod might enhance lung endothelial cell integrity. In addition, in case of a so-called cytokine storm, immunomodulation might be beneficial to reduce mortality. Future studies are needed to explore the risks and therapeutic effects of fingolimod in COVID-19 patients.","Mult Scler Relat Disord","Foerch, Christian","Friedauer, Lucie","Bauer, Boris","Wolf, Timo","Adam, Elisabeth H","32408155"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Fingolimod is used for immune therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis.
