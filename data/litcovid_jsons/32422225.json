Numerous reports are documenting the occurrence of different cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVES: To provide a brief overview of the COVID-19-associated cutaneous lesions. METHODS: Literature search was performed in the PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases up to 30 April 2020.

RESULTS: Literature reports showed a great heterogeneity in COVID-19-associated cutaneous manifestations, as well as in their latency periods and associated extracutaneous symptoms. Pathogenic mechanisms are unknown, although the role of hyperactive immune response, complement activation and microvascular injury has been hypothesized. Based on our experience and the literature data, we subdivided the reported cutaneous lesions into six main clinical patterns: i) urticarial rash, ii) confluent erythematous/maculo-papular/morbilliform rash, iii) papulovesicular exanthem, iv) chilblain-like acral pattern, v) livedo reticularis/racemosa-like pattern, vi) purpuric \"vasculitic\" pattern. These six patterns can be merged into two main settings: the first one - inflammatory/exanthematous - including the first three groups cited above and the second one including the vasculopathic/vasculitic lesions of the last three aforementioned groups.
