Few prior studies have evaluated the well-being of or changes to training for American resident physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to study predictors of trainee well-being and changes to clinical practice using an anonymous survey of American urology residents. METHODS: An anonymous, voluntary, 47-question survey was sent to all ACGME-accredited urology programs in the United States. We executed a cross-sectional analysis evaluating risk factors of perception of anxiety and depression both at work and home and educational outcomes. Multiple linear regressions models were used to estimate beta coefficients and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Among approximately 1,800 urology residents in the USA, 356 (20%) responded. Among these respondents, 24 had missing data leaving a sample size of 332. Important risk factors of mental health outcomes included perception of access to PPE, local COVID-19 severity, and perception of susceptible household members. Risk factors for declination of redeployment included current redeployment, having children, and concerns regarding ability to reach case minimums. Risk factors for concern of achieving operative autonomy included cancellation of elective cases and higher level of training. CONCLUSIONS: Several potential actions, which could be taken by urology residency program directors and hospital administration, may optimize urology resident well-being, morale, and education. These include advocating for adequate access to PPE, providing support at both the residency program and institutional levels, instituting telehealth education programs, and fostering a sense of shared responsibility of COVID-19 patients.","Int J Clin Pract","Khusid, Johnathan A","Weinstein, Corey S","Becerra, Adan Z","Kashani, Mahyar","Robins, Dennis J","Fink, Lauren E","Smith, Matthew T Jr","Weiss, Jeffrey P","32460433"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of COVID-19 has placed tremendous strain on the American healthcare system.

As residents rely upon operative exposure and in-person didactic lectures for education, the disruptions caused by the pandemic have forced programs to revise how they educate residents. Here we surveyed program directors (PDs) to ascertain how they have altered the education and clinical care responsibilities of residents in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Surveys were sent to the PDs of all ACGME-accredited neurosurgery programs. Survey questions targeted changes in resident staffing and coverage, changes in didactic material delivery, and changes in resident wellness initiatives. PD concerns were also elicited. RESULTS: Of the 116 program PDs invited, 57 responded (49.1%). We found that most programs have reduced resident work weeks (65%) and in-hospital resident shift census (95%). Few have redeployed residents and most are increasingly relying on teleconferencing solutions for meetings and resident education.

Continuing education in spite of decreased case volume and maintaining resident morale are cited as the most common concerns of PDs. CONCLUSION: Here we find that there is great homogeneity in the responses of neurosurgical residency programs to the COVID-19 pandemic.
