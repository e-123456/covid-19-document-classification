MAIN: Syria's conflict has displaced more than half its pre-war population leaving 6.7 million people internally displaced; consequent overcrowding with insufficient water, sanitation and healthcare (including laboratory capacity) could lead to conditions which are ideal for spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Syria. Political changes have led to the formation of at least three health systems within Syria's borders, each with their own governance, capacity and planning. This fragmentation with little interaction between them could lead to poor resource allocation and adversely affect control. As such, COVID-19 could overwhelm the health systems (particularly intensive care capacity) leading to high deaths across the population, particularly for the most vulnerable such as detainees.
