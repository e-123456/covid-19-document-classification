OBJECTIVE: To determine the primary healthcare (PHC) facility preparedness towards the provision of safe outpatient services during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among supervisors and managers of primary healthcare facilities attached to medical colleges and institutions in India. A list of 60 faculty involved in the management and supervision of PHCs affiliated to the community medicine departments of medical colleges and institutes across India was compiled from an accessible private organization member database. We collected the data through a rapid survey from April 24-April 30 2020 using a google-forms online digital questionnaire that evaluated preparedness parameters based on self-assessment by the participants. The preparedness domains assessed were infrastructure availability, health worker safety, and patient care. RESULTS: A total of 51 faculty responded to the survey. Each medical college/institution was having on average (SD) a total of 2.94 (1.7) PHCs under its jurisdiction. Infrastructural and infection control deficits at the PHC were reported in terms of limited physical space and queuing capacity, lack of separate entry and exit gates (49%), suboptimal ventilation (57%), and negligible airborne infection control measures (75.5%). N-95 masks were available at 26 (50.9%) sites. Infection prevention and control measures were also suboptimal with inadequate facilities for handwashing and hand hygiene reported in 23.5% and 27.4% sites, respectively.
