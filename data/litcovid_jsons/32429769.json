Telemedicine has emerged as an obvious choice to counter these impediments. However, its potential for maintaining outpatient care at pre-pandemic levels during these rapidly changing times is untested. Therefore, we analyzed our experience in a tertiary care epilepsy center. Methods: We divided the study period from March 1, 2020 to April 15, 2020 into a baseline, transition (to telemedicine), and current phase. We divided outpatient encounters into clinic, virtual (using Cleveland Clinic Express Care Online platform), and telephone (including commercial video conferencing platforms). Results: Completed outpatient visits during baseline and current period were 595 and 590, respectively. Nearly 1 out of 4 patients missed outpatient visits during the transition period. The virtual visits accounted for 19.7% of completed visits during baseline and increased to 66.8% during the current period. There were no telephone visits during the baseline phase but accounted for 26.1% of completed visits during the current phase. Less than 1 percent of completed visits in the current phase were in the clinic. Conclusion: We provide evidence that telemedicine's robust and rapid scalability can help maintain a seamless transition of outpatient care during the pandemic.","Telemed J E Health","Punia, Vineet","Nasr, Gaelle","Zagorski, Victoria","Lawrence, George","Fesler, Jessica","Nair, Dileep","Najm, Imad","32429769"],"abstract":["Introduction: During the current pandemic, measures for preventing SARS-CoV-2 virus exposure has severely impacted the delivery of outpatient clinical care to patients with a chronic neurological condition.

Measures of quality and barriers for rapid use by patients and physicians are not well described. OBJECTIVE: To describe results from a quality improvement initiative during rapid adoptive phase of telemedicine during the pandemic. DESIGN: Patient and physician satisfaction with synchronous audiovisual telemedicine visits was measured during early adoptive phase (April 6-17, 2020) within the division of sports medicine in an academic Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) department. Patients were invited to participate in a quality improvement initiative by completing an online survey at the end of a telemedicine visit. Physicians completed a separate survey. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient measures included visit type, duration of encounter, quality, and satisfaction. Physicians reported on experiences performing telemedicine. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 119 patients (289 telemedicine encounters, response rate 41%) and 13 physiatrists. Telemedicine was utilized primarily for follow-up visits (n=74, 70.6%) and most common duration was 15-29 minutes. Patients rated their telemedicine visit as \"excellent\" or \"very good\" across measures (91.6-95.0%) including addressing concerns, communication, developing a treatment plan, convenience, and satisfaction. Value of completing a future telemedicine visit was measured at 84.9%. Most reported estimated travel time saved in excess of 30 minutes. Rate of no-show was 2.8%. Most physicians (62%) had no prior experience with telemedicine visits, and most were comfortable performing these visits after completing 1-4 sessions (69%). Nearly all physicians (92%) rated their telemedicine experience as very good or excellent. The key barrier identified for telemedicine was technical issues.
