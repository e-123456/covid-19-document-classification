Despite tremendous challenges, community-wide efforts have led to a variety of novel approaches for predicting drug polypharmacology.

The authors particularly discuss some novel, groundbreaking concepts, and methods that have been developed recently and applied to drug polypharmacology studies. EXPERT OPINION: Polypharmacology is evolving and novel concepts are being introduced to counter the current challenges in the field. However, major hurdles remain including incompleteness of high-quality experimental data, lack of in vitro and in vivo assays to characterize multi-targeting agents, shortage of robust computational methods, and challenges to identify the best target combinations and design effective multi-targeting agents.

The rapid development and identification of efficient interventions against SARS-CoV-2 remains a major challenge. Based on the available knowledge of closely related coronavirus and their safety profiles, repurposing of existing antiviral drugs and screening of available databases is considered a near term strategic and economic way to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Herein, we applied computational drug design methods to identify Chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitors from FDA approved antiviral drugs and our in-house database of natural and drug-like compounds of synthetic origin. As a result three FDA approved drugs (Remdesivir, Saquinavir and Darunavir) and two natural compounds (. flavone and coumarine derivatives) were identified as promising hits. Further, MD simulation and binding free energy calculations were performed to evaluate the dynamic behavior, stability of protein-ligand contact, and binding affinity of the hit compounds.
