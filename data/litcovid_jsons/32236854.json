We recorded findings at any chest CT performed in the included children, along with core clinical observations. RESULTS: We included five children from 10 months to 6 years of age (mean 3.4 years). All had had at least one CT scan after admission. Three of these five had CT abnormality on the first CT scan (at 2 days, 4 days and 9 days, respectively, after onset of symptoms) in the form of patchy ground-glass opacities; all normalised during treatment. CONCLUSION: Compared to reports in adults, we found similar but more modest lung abnormalities at CT in our small paediatric cohort.","Pediatr Radiol","Li, Wei","Cui, Huaqian","Li, Kunwei","Fang, Yijie","Li, Shaolin","32162081"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Infection with COVID-19 is currently rare in children.

RESULTS: Small patchy, ground-glass opacity (GGO), and consolidations were the main HRCT signs in 98 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections.
