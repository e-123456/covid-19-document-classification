An analysis of the utilization of palliative care in accordance with patient comorbidities and other characteristics was performed while considering clinical outcomes. Chi square test was used to determine associations between categorical variables while T tests were used to compare continuous variables.

Fifty nine percent (n=24) of those who had palliative consults eventually elected for comfort measures and transitioned to hospice care.
