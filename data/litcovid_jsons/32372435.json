They should be followed where they do not contradict our specific recommendations for the COVID-19 patient group. Consideration should be given to using a checklist that has been specifically modified for the COVID-19 patient group. Early intubation should be considered to prevent the additional risk to staff of emergency intubation and to avoid prolonged use of high flow nasal oxygen or non-invasive ventilation.
