He scored qSOFA 1 of 3 points due to high respiratory rate, and SIRS 2 of 4 points due to high respiratory rate and fever of 39.4 masculine C. PCR for influenza virus was negative and he received benzylpenicillin for pneumonia. The chest X-ray taken initially showed no lung affection. On day 5 after symptom debut he was tested for COVID-19 which was positive. He had not been travelling to high-risk areas or been exposed to any known confirmed COVID-19 patients. On the same day, a chest CT scan was performed that showed ground-glass opacities. In subsequent days the patient's health rapidly deteriorated. He developed irreversible respiratory failure with hypoxia without hypercapnia despite substantial oxygen support. Chest X-ray taken on disease day 7 showed progression of consolidations.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of covid-19 cases among Swiss Armed Forces recruits in the early weeks of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the canton of Ticino, the southernmost canton of Switzerland. Positive cases were defined with two positive PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Serological testing was performed with a commercially available kit according to manufacturers' instructions. RESULTS: The first case was likely contaminated while skiing during weekend permission. He became symptomatic 4 days later, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was put into isolation. He showed complete symptom resolution after 48 hours.

Seven out of nine recruits in one particular quarantine room became mildly symptomatic. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive in one of them. Seven days after initial diagnosis, the index patient and the other one from the quarantine retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, although they had been completely asymptomatic for over 96 hours.
