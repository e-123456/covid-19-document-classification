Based on the urgent need for high-throughput screening, we tested the performance of three alternative, simple and affordable protocols to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2, bypassing the long and tedious RNA extraction step and reducing the time to viral detection. METHODS: We evaluated three methods based on direct nasopharyngeal swab viral transmission medium (VTM) heating before the RT-qPCR: a) direct without additives; b) in a formamide-EDTA (FAE) buffer, c) in a RNAsnap(TM) buffer. RESULTS: Although with a delay in cycle threshold compared to the gold-standard, we found consistent results in nasopharyngeal swab samples that were subject to a direct 70 degrees C incubation for 10 min. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide valuable options to overcome any supply chain issue and help to increase the throughput of diagnostic tests, thereby complementing standard diagnosis.","Int J Infect Dis","Alcoba-Florez, Julia","Gonzalez-Montelongo, Rafaela","Inigo-Campos, Antonio","de Artola, Diego Garcia-Martinez","Gil-Campesino, Helena","The Microbiology Technical Support Team","Ciuffreda, Laura","Valenzuela-Fernandez, Agustin","Flores, Carlos","32492531"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVES: The gold-standard COVID-19 diagnosis relies on detecting SARS-CoV-2 using RNA purification and one-step retrotranscription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).
