Clinical classification (mild, moderate, severe, and critical) was carried out according to the diagnosis and treatment program of novel coronavirus pneumonia (Trial Fifth Edition) issued by the National Health Commission. The research data were analyzed using SPSS19.0 statistical software. Quantitative data were expressed as median (interquartile range), and qualitative data were expressed as frequency and rate. Results: 32 confirmed cases that met the inclusion criteria were included. 28 cases were of mild or moderate type (87.50%), and four cases (12.50%) of severe or critical type. Four cases (12.5%) were combined with one underlying disease (bronchial asthma, coronary heart disease, malignant tumor, chronic kidney disease), and one case (3.13%) was simultaneously combined with high blood pressure and malignant tumor.

According to the relevant diagnostic criteria, the patients were divided into three groups: mild (15 cases), severe (9 cases) and critical (5 cases). The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers in the serum of each group were detected, and the changes of these indicators of the three groups were compared and analyzed, as well as their relationship with the clinical classification of the disease. Results: (1) The main symptoms of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was fever (28/29) with or without respiratory and other systemic symptoms. Two patients died with underlying disease and co-bacterial infection, respectively. (2) The blood test of the patients showed normal or decreased white blood cell count (23/29), decreased lymphocyte count (20/29), increased hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) (27/29), and normal procalcitonin.

DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Seven hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. PARTICIPANTS: 62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection. Data were collected from 10 January 2020 to 26 January 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical data, collected using a standardised case report form, such as temperature, history of exposure, incubation period. If information was not clear, the working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor responsible for treating the patient for clarification. RESULTS: Of the 62 patients studied (median age 41 years), only one was admitted to an intensive care unit, and no patients died during the study. According to research, none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province were ever exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the original source of the virus; all studied cases were infected by human to human transmission. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 35 (56%), headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and haemoptysis in 2 (3%). Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on admission. The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2 (1-4) days. CONCLUSION: As of early February 2020, compared with patients initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Zhejiang province are relatively mild."],"journal":"BMJ","authors":["Xu, Xiao-Wei","Wu, Xiao-Xin","Jiang, Xian-Gao","Xu, Kai-Jin","Ying, Ling-Jun","Ma, Chun-Lian","Li, Shi-Bo","Wang, Hua-Ying","Zhang, Sheng","Gao, Hai-Nv","Sheng, Ji-Fang","Cai, Hong-Liu","Qiu, Yun-Qing","Li, Lan-Juan"],"date":"2020-02-21T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32075786","week":"20208|Feb 17 - Feb 23","doi":"10.1136/bmj.m606","link_erratum_in":"32107200","link_comment_in":"32075791","source":"PubMed","locations":["Zhejiang","Huanan","Wuhan","China","Hangzhou","myalgia"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Mechanism"],"weight":1,"_version_":1661359647351635968,"score":163.47708}]}
