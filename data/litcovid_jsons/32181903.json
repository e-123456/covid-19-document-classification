METHODS: Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed Corona Virus Disease(COVID)-19 in Huizhou municipal central hospitalfrom January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively analysed.

RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that: age, platelet peaks and PLR at peak platelet were the influencing factors in severe patients,multivariate analysis showed that the PLR value at peak platelet during treatment was an independent influencing factor in severe patients.The average hospitalization day of patients with platelet peaks during treatment were longer than those without platelet peaks(P<0.05).The average age of patients with platelet peaks during treatment were older than those without platelet peaks(P<0.05). The patients with significantly elevated platelets during treatment had longer average hospitalization day. And the higher PLR of patients during treatment had longer average hospitalization day. CONCLUSION: Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Huizhou municipal central hospital, presumed that the number of platelets and their dynamic changes during the treatment may have suggestion on the severity and prognosis of disease.

Results: The age of the 31 children with 2019-nCoV infection was 7 years and 1 month (6 months -17 years). Nine cases (29%) were imported cases. Other 21 cases (68%) had contact with confirmed infected adults. One case (3%) had contact with asymptomatic returnees from Wuhan. Among the 31 children, 28 patients (90%) were family cluster cases. The clinical types were asymptomatic type in 4 cases (13%), mild type in 13 cases (42%), and common type in 14 cases (45%). No severe or critical type existed.

After receiving supportive treatment, the viral nucleic acid turned negative in 25 cases within 7-23 days. Among them, 24 children (77%) recovered and were discharged from hospital. No death occurred. Conclusions: In this case series, 2019-nCoV infections in children from six provinces (autonomous region) in northern China are mainly caused by close family contact. Clinical types are asymptomatic, mild and common types. Clinical manifestations and laboratory examination results are nonspecific. Close contact history of epidemiology, nucleic acid detection and chest imaging are important bases for diagnosis. After general treatment, the short-term prognosis is good."],"journal":"Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi","authors":["Wang, D","Ju, X L","Xie, F","Lu, Y","Li, F Y","Huang, H H","Fang, X L","Li, Y J","Wang, J Y","Yi, B","Yue, J X","Wang, J","Wang, L X","Li, B","Wang, Y","Qiu, B P","Zhou, Z Y","Li, K L","Sun, J H","Liu, X G","Li, G D","Wang, Y J","Cao, A H","Chen, Y N"],"date":"2020-03-03T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32118389","week":"202010|Mar 02 - Mar 08","doi":"10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20200225-00138","keywords":["2019 novel coronavirus","Child","Disease attributes"],"source":"PubMed","locations":["Ningxia","n=20","Hebei","Wuhan","Shaanxi","China","Shandong","Gansu","Henan"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Mechanism","Case Report"],"weight":1,"_version_":1661359647593857024,"score":133.42665}]}
