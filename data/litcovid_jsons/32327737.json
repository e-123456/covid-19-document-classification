Patients with metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) are often obese and have additional metabolic risk factors which may aggravate the severity of respiratory diseases and of COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the association between MAFLD and COVID-19 severity. METHODS: 214 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 aged between 18 and 75years from three hospitals in Wenzhou, China were consecutively enrolled. Sixty-six patients with MAFLD were included in the final analysis. COVID-19 was diagnosed as a positive result by high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of oropharyngeal swab specimens. COVID-19 severity was assessed during hospitalization and classified as severe and non-severe based on the current management guideline. All patients were screened for fatty liver by computed tomography and subsequently diagnosed as MAFLD according to a recent set of consensus diagnostic criteria. Obesity was defined as BMI >25kg/m(2). RESULTS: The presence of obesity in MAFLD patients was associated with a~6-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness (unadjusted-OR 5.77, 95% CI 1.19-27.91, p=.029). Notably, this association with obesity and COVID-19 severity remained significant (adjusted-OR 6.32, 95% CI 1.16-34.54, p=.033) even after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the risk of obesity to COVID-19 severity is greater in those with, than those without MAFLD.","Metabolism","Zheng, Kenneth I","Gao, Feng","Wang, Xiao-Bo","Sun, Qing-Feng","Pan, Ke-Hua","Wang, Ting-Yao","Ma, Hong-Lei","Liu, Wen-Yue","George, Jacob","Zheng, Ming-Hua","32320741"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND & AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic in 2020.
