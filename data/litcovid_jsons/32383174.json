OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess self-reported frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders in non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Poland. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 17 and 18, 2020, among 4,516 non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Poland. The questionnaire included eight questions related to the health status, symptoms of COVID-19, comorbidities, and smoking status. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were obtained from 1,942 patients with COVID-19, a response rate of 43%. The median age of the respondents was 50 years; 60.2% were women. Among non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 21.3% had hypertension, 4.5% had diabetes, and 3.1% of COVID-19 cases had chronic respiratory disease. Regular tobacco use was declared by 11.2% of patients with COVID-19. At least one gastrointestinal symptom was reported by 53.6% of patients. Almost half of patients (47%) with COVID-19 reported lack of appetite and 24.2% reported diarrhea.

Self-reported olfactory and taste disorders were 49.2% and 47.5%, respectively. Self-reported frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders during COVID-19 course was significantly higher (p<0.001) among women than men.

Self-reported olfactory impairment has recently been recognized as a hallmark of Covid-19 and may be an important predictor of clinical outcome. METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients presenting to a San Diego Hospital system with laboratory-confirmed positive Covid-19 infection was conducted with evaluation of olfactory and gustatory function and clinical disease course. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were performed to identify risk factors for hospital admission and anosmia. RESULTS: A total of 169 patients tested positive for Covid-19 disease between March 3 and April 8, 2020. Olfactory and gustatory data were obtained for 128/169 (75.7%) subjects of which 26/128 (20.1%) required hospitalization. Admission for Covid-19 was associated with intact sense of smell and taste, increased age, diabetes, as well as subjective and objective parameters associated with respiratory failure.

METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited from 12 European hospitals. The following epidemiological and clinical outcomes have been studied: age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and general and otolaryngological symptoms. Patients completed olfactory and gustatory questionnaires based on the smell and taste component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS). RESULTS: A total of 417 mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients completed the study (263 females). The most prevalent general symptoms consisted of cough, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Face pain and nasal obstruction were the most disease-related otolaryngological symptoms. 85.6% and 88.0% of patients reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively.
