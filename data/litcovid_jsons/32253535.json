METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited from 12 European hospitals. The following epidemiological and clinical outcomes have been studied: age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and general and otolaryngological symptoms. Patients completed olfactory and gustatory questionnaires based on the smell and taste component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS). RESULTS: A total of 417 mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients completed the study (263 females). The most prevalent general symptoms consisted of cough, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Face pain and nasal obstruction were the most disease-related otolaryngological symptoms. 85.6% and 88.0% of patients reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively. There was a significant association between both disorders (p < 0.001). Olfactory dysfunction (OD) appeared before the other symptoms in 11.8% of cases. The sQO-NS scores were significantly lower in patients with anosmia compared with normosmic or hyposmic individuals (p = 0.001). Among the 18.2% of patients without nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea, 79.7% were hyposmic or anosmic. The early olfactory recovery rate was 44.0%. Females were significantly more affected by olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions than males (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Olfactory and gustatory disorders are prevalent symptoms in European COVID-19 patients, who may not have nasal symptoms.

Two such candidate symptoms include anecdotally reported loss of smell and taste. Understanding the timing and association of smell/taste loss in Covid-19 may help facilitate screening and early isolation of cases. METHODS: A single-institution, cross-sectional study evaluating patient-reported symptoms with a focus on smell and taste was conducted using an internet-based platform on adult subjects who underwent testing for Covid-19. Logistic regression was employed to identify symptoms associated with Covid-19 positivity. RESULTS: A total of 1480 patients with influenza-like symptoms underwent Covid-19 testing between March 3 through 29, 2020. Our study captured 59 of 102 (58%) Covid-19-positive patients and 203 of 1378 (15%) Covid-19-negative patients. Smell and taste loss were reported in 68% (40/59) and 71% (42/59) of Covid-19-positive subjects, respectively, compared to 16% (33/203) and 17% (35/203) of Covid-19-negative patients (p<0.001). Smell and taste impairment were independently and strongly associated with Covid-19-positivity (anosmia: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 10.9, 95%CI:5.08-23.5; ageusia: aOR 10.2 95%CI:4.74-22.1); whereas, sore throat was associated with Covid-19-negativity (aOR 0.23, 95%CI:0.11-0.50). Of patients who reported Covid-19-associated loss of smell, 74% (28/38) reported resolution of anosmia with clinical resolution of illness.

Compared with severe and critical groups, there were more patients taking ACEI/ARB in moderate group.
