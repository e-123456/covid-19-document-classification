In order to overcome these challenges, the Polish the National Health Fund has facilitated telemedical consultations. AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare teleconsultations to regular ambulatory clinic of implantable devices (ACIM) visits and to assess whether teleconsultations would be an adequate replacement during a time when face-to-face contact should be limited. METHODS: Teleconsultations in the ACIM were introduced for patients without the possibility of remote control cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED). Prior to planned visits physicians made phone calls and interviewed the patient about their health. Further treatment decisions were made based on the interview and available documentation. RESULTS: Teleconsultations were performed during a 3.5-week period (13.03.2020 to 01.04.2020). Of the 400 patients planned for visits in the ACIM, 349 were consulted by phone. 299 patients confirmed stable health. 14/349 patients reported some symptoms and 4/349 patients were hospitalized; 2/349 patients changed their primary ACIM and were no longer under our care, 1/349 patient was undergoing quarantine, 15/349 patients required additional intervention and 15 patients had died prior to contact. In general patients gave positive feedback on their teleconsultations. CONCLUSIONS: Teleconsultations are a much-needed solution during the COVID-19 pandemic. They are an effective way to decrease interpersonal contact and to overcome sudden changes to the visitation scheme which may otherwise have put an overwhelming burden on the ACIM.","Kardiol Pol","Paskudzka, Diana","Kolodzinska, Agnieszka","Cacko, Andrzej","Stolarz, Przemyslaw","Lyzwinski, Lukasz","Opolski, Grzegorz","Grabowski, Marcin","32469189"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: In the midst of the SARS-CoV 2 pandemic basic healthcare challenges arise as lockdowns and social isolation are implemented to prevent the spread of the virus.
