METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed from the medical data of 23 children, aged from 3 months to 17 years and 8 months, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jiangxi, China from January 21 to February 29, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 23 children with COVID-19, 17 had family aggregation. Three children (13%) had asymptomatic infection, 6 (26%) had mild type, and 14 (61%) had common type. Among these 23 children, 16 (70%) had fever, 11 (48%) had cough, 8 (35%) had fever and cough, and 8 (35%) had wet rales in the lungs. The period from disease onset or the first nucleic acid-positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 to the virus nucleic acid negative conversion was 6-24 days (median 12 days). Of the 23 children, 3 had a reduction in total leukocyte count, 2 had a reduction in lymphocytes, 2 had an increase in C-reactive protein, and 2 had an increase in D-dimer. Abnormal pulmonary CT findings were observed in 12 children, among whom 9 had patchy ground-glass opacities in both lungs. All 23 children received antiviral therapy and were recovered. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 in children aged <18 years often occurs with family aggregation, with no specific clinical manifestation and laboratory examination results. Most of these children have mild symptoms and a good prognosis. Epidemiological history is of particular importance in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in children aged <18 years.","Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi","Wu, Hua-Ping","Li, Bing-Fei","Chen, Xiao","Hu, Hua-Zhu","Jiang, Shu-Ai","Cheng, Hao","Hu, Xin-He","Tang, Jian-Xin","Zhong, Fu-Chu","Zeng, Ling-Wen","Yu, Wei","Yuan, Yan","Wu, Xian-Fei","Li, Yu-Ping","Zheng, Zong-Li","Pan, Tian-Bo","Wu, Zhi-Xing","Yuan, Jin-Feng","Chen, Qiang","32434634"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children aged <18 years. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed from the medical data of 23 children, aged from 3 months to 17 years and 8 months, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jiangxi, China from January 21 to February 29, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 23 children with COVID-19, 17 had family aggregation. Three children (13%) had asymptomatic infection, 6 (26%) had mild type, and 14 (61%) had common type. Among these 23 children, 16 (70%) had fever, 11 (48%) had cough, 8 (35%) had fever and cough, and 8 (35%) had wet rales in the lungs. The period from disease onset or the first nucleic acid-positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 to the virus nucleic acid negative conversion was 6-24 days (median 12 days). Of the 23 children, 3 had a reduction in total leukocyte count, 2 had a reduction in lymphocytes, 2 had an increase in C-reactive protein, and 2 had an increase in D-dimer. Abnormal pulmonary CT findings were observed in 12 children, among whom 9 had patchy ground-glass opacities in both lungs. All 23 children received antiviral therapy and were recovered. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 in children aged <18 years often occurs with family aggregation, with no specific clinical manifestation and laboratory examination results. Most of these children have mild symptoms and a good prognosis. Epidemiological history is of particular importance in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in children aged <18 years."],"journal":"Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi","authors":["Wu, Hua-Ping","Li, Bing-Fei","Chen, Xiao","Hu, Hua-Zhu","Jiang, Shu-Ai","Cheng, Hao","Hu, Xin-He","Tang, Jian-Xin","Zhong, Fu-Chu","Zeng, Ling-Wen","Yu, Wei","Yuan, Yan","Wu, Xian-Fei","Li, Yu-Ping","Zheng, Zong-Li","Pan, Tian-Bo","Wu, Zhi-Xing","Yuan, Jin-Feng","Chen, Qiang"],"date":"2020-05-22T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32434634","source":"PubMed","week":"202021|May 18 - May 24","locations":["Jiangxi","China","Jiangxi","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1667521393568251904,"score":258.17935}]}
