Patients with metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) are often obese and have additional metabolic risk factors which may aggravate the severity of respiratory diseases and of COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the association between MAFLD and COVID-19 severity. METHODS: 214 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 aged between 18 and 75years from three hospitals in Wenzhou, China were consecutively enrolled. Sixty-six patients with MAFLD were included in the final analysis. COVID-19 was diagnosed as a positive result by high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of oropharyngeal swab specimens. COVID-19 severity was assessed during hospitalization and classified as severe and non-severe based on the current management guideline. All patients were screened for fatty liver by computed tomography and subsequently diagnosed as MAFLD according to a recent set of consensus diagnostic criteria. Obesity was defined as BMI >25kg/m(2). RESULTS: The presence of obesity in MAFLD patients was associated with a~6-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness (unadjusted-OR 5.77, 95% CI 1.19-27.91, p=.029). Notably, this association with obesity and COVID-19 severity remained significant (adjusted-OR 6.32, 95% CI 1.16-34.54, p=.033) even after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia.

The relation between obesity and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not been fully documented. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study we analyzed the relationship between clinical characteristics, including body mass index (BMI), and the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in 124 consecutive patients admitted in intensive care for SARS-CoV-2, in a single French center. RESULTS: Obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) and severe obesity (BMI >35 kg/m2) were present in 47.6% and 28.2% of cases, respectively. Overall, 85 patients (68.6%) required IMV. The proportion of patients who required IMV increased with BMI categories (p<0.01, Chi square test for trend), and it was greatest in patients with BMI >35 kg/m2 (85.7%).
