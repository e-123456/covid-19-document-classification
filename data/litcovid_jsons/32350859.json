However, traditional SPM neglects the pattern repetition in sequence. To solve this problem, gap constraint SPM was proposed and can avoid finding too many useless patterns. Nonoverlapping SPM, as a branch of gap constraint SPM, means that any two occurrences cannot use the same sequence letter in the same position as the occurrences. Nonoverlapping SPM can make a balance between efficiency and completeness. The frequent patterns discovered by existing methods normally contain redundant patterns.

A backtracking strategy is employed to calculate the nonoverlapping support of a pattern on the corresponding Nettree, which reduces the time complexity.
