Up to now, 109 cases have been discharged from the hospital, and 9 patients died. The ACE2 expression levels were up-regulated in patients of severe type and critically ill type. CONCLUSION: Clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and CT imaging should be combined for comprehensive analysis to diagnose COVID-19. ACE2 may be the receptor of COVID-19."],"journal":"Infection","authors":["Zhang, Hong","Shang, Wenli","Liu, Qinghua","Zhang, Xuejing","Zheng, Maochuan","Yue, Maokui"],"date":"2020-05-12T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32390091","source":"PubMed","week":"202020|May 11 - May 17","doi":"10.1007/s15010-020-01440-5","keywords":["ace2","clinical characteristics","coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19)","huanggang","novel coronavirus pneumonia","taian"],"locations":["Huanggang","Hubei","Taian","Shandong","Huanggang","Taian","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666528580047208448,"score":235.53302},{"pmid":32425649,"pmcid":"PMC7233257","title":"Clinical characteristics and co-infections of 354 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.","text":["Clinical characteristics and co-infections of 354 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.","From December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, caused an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China and globally.
