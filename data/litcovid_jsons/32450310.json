Being essential services, we postulated that there would not be a decrease in elective and emergency neurosurgical presentations and surgeries. METHODS: This is a prospective, observational, epidemiological study in strict adherence to the STROBE guidelines. It is a cross-sectional, multicentric study involving five tertiary neurosurgical centres to capture all public neurosurgical admissions in Queensland during the last three months (Feb-April, 2020) of significant public health policy changes to combat COVID-19. RESULTS: An analysis of the 1,298 admissions for the Queensland population of 5.07 million Australians demonstrated a decrease in the number of elective and emergency admissions. The decline in elective admissions, particularly degenerative spine, benign neoplasms and vascular pathologies, was a direct response of government strategy to curb activity to urgent surgical interventions only. Moreover, a trend towards decline in emergency admissions was also noted, partly explained by fewer trauma, but partly attributed to a decline in vascular pathologies including subarachnoid haemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to Europe and North America, this study demonstrates the impact of proactive public health measures in Australia that successfully flattened the COVID-19 curve, whilst facilitating ongoing care of the acutely unwell neurosurgical patients.","World Neurosurg","Antony, Joyce","James, William Thomas","Neriamparambil, Anna Jolly","Barot, Dwarkesh Dharmendra","Withers, Teresa","32450310"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess the impact of public health policy in Australia in response to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the delivery of neurosurgical services.
