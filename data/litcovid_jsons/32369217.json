Patients were confirmed by PCR test. Demographic, clinical and outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 104 patients, 48 (46.15%) were imported cases who were immigrated from Wuhan; 93 (89.42%) had a definite contact history with infections.

Understanding the evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. METHODS: We collected individual information from official public sources on laboratory-confirmed cases reported outside Hubei in mainland China for the period of Jan 19 to Feb 17, 2020. We used the date of the fourth revision of the case definition (Jan 27) to divide the epidemic into two time periods (Dec 24 to Jan 27, and Jan 28 to Feb 17) as the date of symptom onset. We estimated trends in the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level. FINDINGS: We collected data on 8579 cases from 30 provinces. The median age of cases was 44 years (33-56), with an increasing proportion of cases in younger age groups and in elderly people (ie, aged >64 years) as the epidemic progressed. The mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4.4 days (95% CI 0.0-14.0) for the period of Dec 24 to Jan 27, to 2.6 days (0.0-9.0) for the period of Jan 28 to Feb 17.

We estimated that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than 3 weeks, with mean Rt reaching peaks between 1.08 (95% CI 0.74-1.54) in Shenzhen city of Guangdong province and 1.71 (1.32-2.17) in Shandong province. In all the locations for which we had sufficient data coverage of Rt, Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold (ie, <1) after Jan 30. INTERPRETATION: Our estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were similar, suggesting an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission before the onset of symptoms. Our results also indicate that, as the epidemic progressed, infectious individuals were isolated more quickly, thus shortening the window of transmission in the community.

RESULTS: Of the 200 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 98 (49.0 %) were male, and the mean age was 55 years. Eighty-seven (43.5 %) had no linkage to Wuhan or contact history. Familial clustering was found in 34 patients. Sixtyfive (32.5 %) suffered from chronic diseases. The common symptoms included fever (171[85.5 %]), cough (116[58.0 %]), and fatigue (64[32 %]). Most patients had lymphopenia. One hundred and seventy-two (86 %) patients showed typical imaging findings of viral pneumonia. Most patients received antiviral, antibiotic, and corticosteroid treatment. Compared with the non-ICU patients, 29 (14.5 %) patients in the ICU were older and more likely to show dyspnea and complications including ARDS. As of Feb 26, 15 (51.7 %) patients in the ICU had died. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 infection was of clustering onset and can cause severe respiratory disease and even death. The mortality of ICU patients with COVID-19 was considerably high."],"journal":"J Clin Virol","authors":["Yang, Luhuan","Liu, Jinglan","Zhang, Rong","Li, Mingwu","Li, Zifeng","Zhou, Xiaojing","Hu, Chuanjun","Tian, Fei","Zhou, Fating","Lei, Yunhong"],"date":"2020-06-03T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32485619","source":"PubMed","week":"202023|Jun 01 - Jun 07","doi":"10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104475","keywords":["covid-19","clinical features","epidemiology","pneumonia","sars-cov-2"],"locations":["China","Yichang","Hubei","China","Yichang","Wuhan","Wuhan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Treatment","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1668704334435581954,"score":258.39572}]}
