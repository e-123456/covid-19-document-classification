In both electronic databases, the following search strategy was implemented and these key words (in the title/abstract) were used: \"COVID 19\" OR \"coronavirus\" AND \"brain\" OR \"CNS\" OR \"neurologic\". RESULTS: Through the search strategy, we could identify two articles about neurological involvement by COVID-19. One of these publications was a narrative review and the other one was a viewpoint.
