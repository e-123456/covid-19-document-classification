Effective contact tracing for potentially exposed healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial for the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks in the healthcare setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of contact tracing through real-time locating systems (RTLS) and electronic medical records (EMRs) review at the designated hospital for COVID-19 response in Singapore, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Over a two-day study period, all admitted COVID-19 patients, their ward locations, and the HCWs rostered to each ward, were identified to determine the total number of potential contacts between COVID-19 patients and HCWs. The number of staff-patient contacts determined by EMR reviews, RTLS-based contact tracing, and a combination of both methods were evaluated. The use of EMR and RTLS-based contact tracing methods were further validated by comparing their sensitivity and specificity against self-reported staff-patient contacts by HCWs. RESULTS: Of 796 potential staff-patient contacts (between 17 patients and 162 staff), 104(13.1%) were identified on both RTLS and EMR, 54(6.8%) by RTLS alone, 99(12.4%) by EMR alone, and 539(67.7%) not identified through either method. Compared to self-reported contacts, EMR reviews had a sensitivity of 47.2% and specificity of 77.9%, while RTLS had a sensitivity of 72.2% and specificity of 87.7%. The highest sensitivity was obtained by including all contacts identified by either RTLS or EMR (sensitivity 77.8%, specificity 73.4%). CONCLUSIONS: RTLS-based contact tracing had higher sensitivity and specificity than EMR reviews. An integration of both methods provided the best performance for rapid contact tracing, although technical adjustments to the RTLS and increasing user compliance with wearing RTLS tags consistently remain necessary.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing smartphone app that respects user privacy by not collecting location information or other personal data.

Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19. METHODS: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R0), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. FINDINGS: Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R0 of 1.5, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R0 was 2.5 or 3.5 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R0 of 2.5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3.5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1.5. For R0 values of 2.5 or 3.5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. INTERPRETATION: In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.
