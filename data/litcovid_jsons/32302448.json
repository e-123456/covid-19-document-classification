OBJECTIVES: Prospective observational study aimed to characterize the coagulation profile of COVID-19 ARDS patients with standard and viscoelastic coagulation tests, and to evaluate their changes after establishment of an aggressive thromboprophylaxis.

Ten patients were followed in the subsequent 7 days, after increasing the dose of low molecular weight heparin, antithrombin levels correction, and clopidogrel in selected cases. RESULTS: At baseline, the patients showed a pro-coagulant profile characterized by an increased clot strength (CS, median 55 hPa, 95% interquartile range 35-63), platelet contribution to CS (PCS, 43 hPa, interquartile range 24-45), fibrinogen contribution to CS (FCS, 12 hPa, interquartile range 6-13.5 elevated D-dimer levels (5.5 mug/mL, interquartile range 2.5-6.5), hyperfibrinogenemia (794 mg/dL, interquartile range 583-933).
