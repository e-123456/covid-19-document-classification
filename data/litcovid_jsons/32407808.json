METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search to identify published and unpublished studies using OVID Medline and pre-print servers (medRxiv, LitCovid, and SSRN) up until April 5 2020; major journal sites were monitored for US publications until April 19 2020. We analyzed the prevalence of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain as well as LFT abnormalities using a fixed effect model and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. RESULTS: We identified 118 studies and used a hierarchal study selection process to identify unique cohorts. We performed a meta-analysis of 47 studies including 10,890 unique patients.

The most common GI symptoms reported are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. Liver chemistry abnormalities are common and include elevation of aspartate transferase, alanine transferase, and total bilirubin. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects the GI tract via its viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II, which is expressed on enterocytes of the ileum and colon. Viral RNA has also been isolated from stool specimens of COVID-19 patients, which raised the concern for fecal-oral transmission in addition to droplet transmission. Although indirect evidence has suggested possible fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, more effort is needed to establish the role of the fecal-oral transmission route. Further research will help elucidate the association between patients with underlying GI diseases, such as chronic liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease, and severity of COVID-19. In this review, we summarize the data on GI involvement to date, as well as the impact of COVID-19 on underlying GI diseases.","World J Gastroenterol","Cha, Ming Han","Regueiro, Miguel","Sandhu, Dalbir S","32476796"],"abstract":["The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic, manifested by an infectious pneumonia.
