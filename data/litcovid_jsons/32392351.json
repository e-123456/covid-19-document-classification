Changes that may seem relatively minor in comparison to the global pandemic have the potential to be drastic turning points in the career progression of many.

These presentations play a large role in distinguishing applicants during the residency application process, and therefore these lost opportunities have the potential to be a serious detriment to medical students' career trajectory.

For medical students interested in pursuing neurosurgery as a specialty, educational policies surrounding COVID-19 present unique challenges. This study utilizes a nationwide survey to identify concerns held by students interested in pursuing neurosurgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Students who previously registered for the Medical Student Neurosurgery Training Camps were sent an online Qualtrics survey, requesting them to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic was affecting their neurosurgical education. The Pearson Chi-Square test and post-hoc pairwise Fisher's exact test were used for analysis of categorical variables and the two-tailed paired Student's t-test was utilized for continuous variables. Results: The survey was distributed to 852 medical students with 127 complete responses. Concerns regarding conferences/networking opportunities (63%), clinical experience (59%), and board exam scores (42%) were most frequently cited. 76% of M3s reported at least one cancelled/postponed neurosurgery rotation.
