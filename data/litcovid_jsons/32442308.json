AIMS: To investigate clinical outcomes, distribution of quarantine locations, and the infection status of the contacts of COVID-19 patients after discharge. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. METHODS: Demographics, baseline characteristics of 131 COVID-19 patients discharged from February 3 to 21, 2020 in Wuhan, China were collected and analyzed by reviewing the medical records retrospectively. Post-hospitalization data related to clinical outcomes, quarantine locations and close contact history were obtained by following up the patients every week up to 4 weeks. RESULTS: 53 (40.05%) patients on discharge had cough (29.01%), fatigue (7.63%), expectoration (6.11%), chest tightness (6.11%), dyspnea (3.82%), chest pain (3.05%), and palpitation (1.53%). These symptoms constantly declined in 4 weeks post discharge. Transient fever recurred in 11 (8.4%) patients. 78 (59.5%) discharged patients underwent chest CT and 2 (1.53%) showed deterioration. 94 (71.8%) patients received SARS-CoV-2 retest and 8 (6.10%) reported positive. 7 (2.29%) patients were re-admitted because of fever or positive SARS-CoV-2 retest. 121 (92.37%) and 4 (3.05%) patients were self-quarantined at home or community spots following discharge, with totally 167 closely contacted persons free of COVID-19 at the endpoint of study. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of COVID-19 patients after discharge were in the course of recovery. Readmission was required in rare cases due to suspected recurrence of COVID-19. Although no contacted infection observed, appropriate self-quarantine and regular reexamination are necessary, particularly for those who have recurred symptoms.","QJM","Wang, Xingyu","Xu, Hao","Jiang, Haini","Wang, Liuming","Lu, Chao","Wei, Xiang","Liu, Jihong","Xu, Shuyun","32442308"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a global pandemic but the follow-up data of discharged patients was barely described.

METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by RT-PCR who were discharged consecutively from the hospital between 5 February 2020 and 10 March 2020 and who underwent serial chest CT scans on schedule were enrolled. The radiological characteristics of all patients were collected and analysed. The total CT score was the sum of non-GGO involvement determined at discharge.

RESULTS: A total of 149 patients who completed all CT scans were evaluated; there were 67 (45.0%) men and 82 (55.0%) women, with a median age of 43 years old (IQR 36-56).

Baseline CT findings including lobar distribution, presence of ground glass opacities, consolidation, linear opacities, and lung severity score were evaluated.

Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to explore the association between initial CT, clinical or laboratory findings, and discharge with recovery, whereby hazard ratio (HR) values < 1 indicated a lower rate of discharge at four weeks and longer time until discharge. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients recovered and were discharged during the study period with a median length of admission of 16 days (range, 9 to 25 days), while the rest remained hospitalized at the end of this study (median, 17.5 days; range, 4 to 27 days).
