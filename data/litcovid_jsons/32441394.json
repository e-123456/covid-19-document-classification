State-of-the-art review.","BACKGROUND: Guidelines for ultrasonic devices use are imperative because infectious aerosols arising from airway procedures were a key etiologic factor in prior coronavirus outbreaks. This manuscript aims to summarize the available recommendations and the most relevant concepts about the use of ultrasonic scalpel during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: Literature review of manuscripts with patients, animal models, or in vitro studies where the ultrasonic scalpel was used and the plume produced was analyzed in a quantitative and/ or qualitative way. DISCUSSION: Activated devices with tissue produce a biphasic bioaerosol composed (size 68.3-994 nm) of tissue particles, blood, intact and no viable cells, and carcinogenic or irritant hydrocarbons (benzene, ethylbenzene, styrene, toluene, heptene, and methylpropene). CONCLUSION: It is imperative to use an active smoke evacuator, to avoid ultrasonic scalpel use in COVID-19 positive patients and in upper airway surgery, as well as to follow the protection recommendations of the guidelines for management this type of patients.","Head Neck","Mayo-Yanez, Miguel","Calvo-Henriquez, Christian","Lechien, Jerome R","Fakhry, Nicolas","Ayad, Tareck","Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos M","32441394"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Guidelines for ultrasonic devices use are imperative because infectious aerosols arising from airway procedures were a key etiologic factor in prior coronavirus outbreaks.
