The purpose of this study was to investigate early clinical and CT manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) were enrolled in this retrospective study. The clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and CT findings were evaluated. RESULTS. One hundred eight patients (38 men, 70 women; age range, 21-90 years) were included in the study. The clinical manifestations were fever in 94 of 108 (87%) patients, dry cough in 65 (60%), and fatigue in 42 (39%). The laboratory results were normal WBC count in 97 (90%) patients and normal or reduced lymphocyte count in 65 (60%). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein level was elevated in 107 (99%) patients. The distribution of involved lobes was one lobe in 38 (35%) patients, two or three lobes in 24 (22%), and four or five lobes in 46 (43%). The major involvement was peripheral (97 patients [90%]), and the common lesion shape was patchy (93 patients [86%]). Sixty-five (60%) patients had ground-glass opacity (GGO), and 44 (41%) had GGO with consolidation.

Two thoracic radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT signs of the lesions and also scored the extent of involvement of the CT signs. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare lesion distribution and CT scores. The chi-square test was used to compare the CT signs of early-phase versus advanced-phase COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS. A total of 62 patients (39 men and 23 women; mean [+/- SD] age, 52.8 +/- 12.2 years; range, 30-77 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Twenty-four of 30 patients who underwent routine blood tests (80.0%) had a decreased lymphocyte count. Of 27 patients who had their erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level assessed, 18 (66.7%) had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and all 27 (100.0%) had an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. Multiple lesions were seen on the initial CT scan of 52 of 62 patients (83.9%). Forty-eight of 62 patients (77.4%) had predominantly peripheral distribution of lesions.

The mean CT score for the anterior area (4.4 +/- 4.1) was significantly lower than that for the posterior area (7.7 +/- 6.3) (p = 0.003). CT findings for the patients were as follows: 25 patients (40.3%) had ground-glass opacities (GGO), 21 (33.9%), consolidation; 39 (62.9%), GGO plus a reticular pattern; 34 (54.8%), vacuolar sign; 28 (45.2%), microvascular dilation sign; 35 (56.5%), fibrotic streaks; 21 (33.9%), a subpleural line; and 33 (53.2%), a subpleural transparent line. With regard to bronchial changes seen on CT, 45 patients (72.6%) had air bronchogram, and 11 (17.7%) had bronchus distortion. In terms of pleural changes, CT showed that 30 patients (48.4%) had pleural thickening, 35 (56.5%) had pleural retraction sign, and six (9.7%) had pleural effusion. Compared with early-phase disease (</= 7 days after the onset of symptoms), advanced-phase disease (8-14 days after the onset of symptoms) was characterized by significantly increased frequencies of GGO plus a reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, fibrotic streaks, a subpleural line, a subpleural transparent line, air bronchogram, bronchus distortion, and pleural effusion; however, GGO significantly decreased in advanced-phase disease.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical and imaging data of 9 patients with 2019 novel coronavirus infection diagnosed in one fever clinicic in Beijing from January 18, 2020 to February 3, 2020. Results: 5 male and 4 female was included in those 9 patients, whose median age was 36 years, and the age range from 15 to 49 years. 8 of these patients had no underlying disease and one suffered from diabetes. 7 patients had a history of travel to Wuhan City or Hubei Province, and one patient was a medical staff. Two family clustered was found. The incubation period was 1 to 6 days. The clinical manifestations were fever in 8 cases (8/9) , dry cough in 5 cases (5/9) , pharyngalgia in 4 cases (4/9) , fatigue in 4 cases (4/9) , body soreness in 4 cases (4/9) , and blocked or watery nose in 1 case (1/9) . Six patients (6/9) had abnormal cell peripheral blood, of which 3 (3/9) had an increased monocyte count, 2 (2/9) had a reduced lymphocyte , and 1 (1/9) had an increased leukocyte count, while the 3 patients had normal cell blood routines. The median of CRP was 16.3 mg/L, including 5 patients with slightly elevated (5/9) , 4 patients with normal values (4/9) . the results of procalcitonin test were negative in5 patients. Three patients were examined by chest X-ray examination, one of which was normal, one case showed infiltrates of right upper lung, and another showed in right lower lung. All patients underwent chest HRCT. And 7 cases (7/9) showed multiple ground glass exudation, including 5 cases (5/7) involved bilateral lungs, 2 cases (2/7) involved unilateral lung, 3 cases (3/7) with patchy consolidation, and 2 cases (2/9) showed no abnormality. Conclusions: The patents with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in this study generally have an epidemiological history. The clinical manifestations are fever and cough. Peripheral white blood cell counts were most normal And PCT were all negative. Chest HRCT manifested as multiple ground-glass opacities with partly consolidation. Some patients had normal chest radiographs but HRCT showed pneumonia. Some patients had no pneumonia on chest HRCT.","Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi","Zhang, M Q","Wang, X H","Chen, Y L","Zhao, K L","Cai, Y Q","An, C L","Lin, M G","Mu, X D","32061066"],"abstract":["Objective: To summarize and analyze the clinical and imaging characteristics of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in the early stage in Beijing.
