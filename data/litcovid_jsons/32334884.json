Speakers and moderators were also invited to complete a custom developed satisfaction survey. The working parties of TROG (head neck/skin, genitourinary, breast and lung) were also sampled. RESULTS: In total, 188/273 (69%) registered participants logged in to the live virtual meeting. The online engagement for each of the oral sessions ranged from 53-66%. There were 102 and 57 responders to the online pre and post meeting surveys, respectively. The majority of pre meeting responders indicated a significant level of employer support to attend the virtual meeting. Post meeting satisfaction exceeded pre meeting expectations ('very much' and 'quite a bit'; 86% v 54%; p<0.0001). The majority indicated they would be 'quite a bit' or 'very much' interested in future live virtual meetings. CONCLUSION: The TROG 2020 ASM was conducted as a live virtual meeting.
