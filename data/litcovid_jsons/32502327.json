METHODS: We report on a family of three adults who experienced photophobia, intense eye pain, epiphora, blurred vision, and burning sensation over the face and neck area after a short period of unprotected exposure to UV germicidal lamps. RESULTS: Initial examination revealed erythema and tenderness over the face and neck area, reduced visual acuity of 6/12, and conjunctival injections bilaterally in all three patients. Further assessment at the ophthalmology department three days later revealed gradual improvement of visual acuity to 6/6 bilaterally. Slit-lamp examinations revealed few punctate epithelial erosions. Fundal examinations were normal without evidence of solar retinopathy. The patients were diagnosed with germicidal-range UV irradiation-induced photokeratitis and epidermal phototoxicity. Lubricants and emollients were prescribed for symptom relief, and the patients were warned against using a UV germicidal lamp for disinfection purposes without appropriate protection.
