We aimed to obtain nation wide data from Nepal, about hospital preparedness for COVID-19.

The questionnaire was circulated to the over 800 doctors across the nation, who are the life members of six medical societies. RESULTS: We obtained 131 completed responses from all seven provinces. Majority of respondents had anaesthesiology as the primary specialty. Only 52 (39.7%) participants mentioned that their hospital had policy to receive suspected or proven cases with COVID-19. Presence of isolation ward was mentioned by 83 (63.4%) respondents, with only 9 (6.9%)mentioning the presence of airborne isolation.
