The disease spectrum ranges from asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic presentations to acute respiratory failure. At the present time the absolute number of severe cases requiring ventilator support is reaching or even surpassing the intensive care unit bed capacity in the most affected regions and countries. OBJECTIVES: To narratively summarize the available literature on the management of COVID-19, in the attempt to combine current evidence and frontline opinions and provide balanced answers to pressing clinical questions. SOURCES: Inductive PubMed search for publications relevant to the topic. CONTENT: The available literature and the authors' frontline-based opinion are summarized in brief narrative answers to selected clinical questions, plus a conclusive statement for each answer. IMPLICATIONS: Many off-label antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs are currently being administered to patients with COVID-19. Physicians must be aware that, being not supported by high-level evidence, these treatments may often be ethically justifiable only in those worsening patients unlikely to improve only with supportive care, and who cannot be enrolled in randomized clinical trials (RCT).

As a result, 16 additional questions were forwarded to the SFR, and answered by the board.

Therefore, measuring and analyzing online health communication and public sentiment is essential for establishing effective and efficient disease control policies, especially in the early stage of the outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the trends of online health communication, analyze the focus of people's anxiety in the early stages of COVID-19, and evaluate the appropriateness of online information. METHODS: From NAVER, the most popular Korean web portal, 13,148 questions and 29,040 answers related to COVID-19 from 01/20/2020 to 03/02/2020 were collected. Three main methods were used in this study: 1) the structural topic model was used to examine the topics in the online questions, 2) word network analysis was conducted to analyze the focus of people's anxiety and worry in the questions, and 3) two medical doctors assessed the appropriateness of the answers to the questions, which were primarily related to people's anxiety. RESULTS: Fifty topics and six cohesive topic communities were identified from the questions. Among them, topic community No. 4 (suspecting COVID-19 infection after developing a particular symptom) accounted for the largest portion of the questions. As the number of confirmed patients increased, the proportion of topics belonging to topic community No. 4 also increased. Additionally, the prolonged situation led to a slight increase in the proportion of topics related to job issues. People's anxieties and worries were closely related with physical symptoms and self-protection methods. While relatively appropriate to suspect physical symptoms, a high proportion of answers related to self-protection methods were assessed as misinformation or advertisements. CONCLUSIONS: Search activity for online information regarding the COVID-19 outbreak has been active. Many of the online questions were related to people's anxieties and worries. A considerable portion of corresponding answers had false information or were advertisements. The study results could contribute reference information to various countries that need to monitor public anxiety and provide appropriate information in the early stage of an infectious disease outbreak, including COVID-19. Our research also contributes to developing methods for measuring public opinion and sentiment in an epidemic situation based on natural language data on the Internet.
