Our objective was to describe the ultrasonographic lung pattern on newborns with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Newborns who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR in respiratory samples and were evaluated with point-of-care lung ultrasound (LU) from March to April 2020 were included. LU was performed bedside by a single investigator at the time of diagnosis and every 48 h during the first week following diagnosis. Six areas were studied. Three neonates were included. Infants' comorbidities included meconium aspiration syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and Hirschsprung's disease. One required mechanical ventilation. No deaths occurred. LU showed B-lines, consolidation, and spared areas. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion was observedConclusions: LU could be of value when managing COVID-19 neonates.
