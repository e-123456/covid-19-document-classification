METHODS: CT image data of 187 COVID-19 patients were analyzed in the period of hospitalization. CT scanning was performed on admission and repeated every 3 days. The improvement time of clinical symptoms and the image changes of follow-up CT were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: All 187 patients' nucleic acid test were positive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The early CT images of lung in 187 cases (100%) showed multiple patchy and ground-glass opacities with fine mesh and consolidation shade, which mainly distributed in pulmonary band or under the pleura. In the progressive stage, the pulmonary lesions in 146 cases (78.1%) were mainly consolidation, accompanied by air bronchogram, thickening of blood vessels, and interstitial changes. Severe pulmonary CT images in 15 cases (8%) showed diffuse lesions in both lungs, displaying consolidation, or \"white lung\".

Ninety-five patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results were included in this study and we retrospectively analysed their CT imaging characteristics. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients underwent 2-3 SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests and received a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19. Fifty-three were male and 42 were female, and their mean age was 42 +/- 12 years (range: 10 months to 81 years). Sixty-nine patients (72.6%) experienced fever, fatigue, and dry cough, while 15 (15.8%) had poor appetite and fatigue, and 11 (11.6%) had a dry cough and no fever. On CT imaging, early stage patients (n = 53, 55.8%) showed peripheral subpleural ground-glass opacities; these were mainly local patches (22/53, 41.5%), while some lesions were accompanied by interlobular septal thickening.
