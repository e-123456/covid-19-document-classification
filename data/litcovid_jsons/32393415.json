Previous pandemics appear to cause multiple losses both directly related to death itself but also in terms of disruption to social norms, rituals and mourning practices. This affects the ability for an individual to connect with the deceased both before and after the death, potentially increasing the risk of complicated grief. In view of the limited research, specific learning from the current COVID-19 crisis and the impact on the bereaved would be pertinent.
