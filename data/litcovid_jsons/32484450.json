Clinical indicators were compared between different groups. RESULTS: The differences in gender, age, the proportion of patients with combined heart disease, leukocyte, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet, D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase and albumin on admission between the two groups were statistically significant (p<0.05).
