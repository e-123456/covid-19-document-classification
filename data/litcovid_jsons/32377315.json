Threats to mental health, psychological safety and well being are now emerging, increasing the impact of this virus on world health. Providing support for these challenges is difficult because of very high numbers of people requiring support in the context of a need to maintain physical distancing. This protocol describes use of text messaging (Text4Hope) as a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention. This program is evidence-based, with prior research supporting good outcomes and high user satisfaction. OBJECTIVE: The project goal is to implement a program of daily supportive text messaging (Text4Hope) to reduce distress related to the COVID-19 crisis initially amongst Canadians. Prevalence of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, demographic correlates of the same, and the outcomes of the Text4Hope intervention in mitigating distress will be evaluated. METHODS: Self-administered, anonymous, online questionnaires will be used to assess stress (Perceived Stress Scale), anxiety (GAD-7), and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9). Data will be collected at baseline (onset of text messaging), at program midpoint (6-weeks), and end (12-weeks). RESULTS: Data analysis will include parametric and non-parametric techniques, focusing on primary outcomes (i.e., stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms) and metrics of use, including number of subscribers and user satisfaction. Given the large size of the data set, machine learning and data-mining methods will also be used. CONCLUSIONS: This COVID-19 project will provide key information regarding prevalence rates of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms during the pandemic, demographic correlates of distress, and outcome data related to this scalable population-level intervention.

This e-package includes evidence-based guidance, support and signposting relating to psychological wellbeing for all UK healthcare employees. A three-step rapid development process included public involvement activities (PPIs) (STEP 1), content and technical development with iterative peer review (STEP 2), and delivery and evaluation (STEP 3). The package outlines the actions that team leaders can take to provide psychologically safe spaces for staff, together with guidance on communication and reducing social stigma, peer and family support, signposting others through psychological first aid (PFA), self-care strategies (e.g., rest, work breaks, sleep, shift work, fatigue, healthy lifestyle behaviours), and managing emotions (e.g., moral injury, coping, guilt, grief, fear, anxiety, depression, preventing burnout and psychological trauma). The e-package includes advice from experts in mental wellbeing as well as those with direct pandemic experiences from the frontline, as well as signposting to public mental health guidance.
