Here, we describe the clinical characteristics of and outcomes in patients with diabetes in whom COVID-19 has been confirmed or clinically diagnosed (with typical features on lung imaging and symptoms), and their association with glucose-lowering or blood pressure-lowering medications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective study involving 904 patients with COVID-19 (136 with diabetes, mostly type 2 diabetes), clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected and compared between the group with diabetes and the group without diabetes, and between groups taking different medications. Logistic regression was used in order to explore risk factors associated with mortality or poor prognosis. RESULTS: The proportion of comorbid diabetes is similar between cases of confirmed and of clinically diagnosed COVID-19. Risk factors for higher mortality of patients with diabetes and COVID-19 were older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.09 [95% CI 1.04, 1.15] per year increase; P = 0.001) and elevated C-reactive protein (aOR 1.12 [95% CI 1.00, 1.24]; P = 0.043). Insulin usage (aOR 3.58 [95% CI 1.37, 9.35]; P = 0.009) was associated with poor prognosis. Clinical outcomes of those who use an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blocker (ARB) were comparable with those of patients who do not use ACEI/ARB among patients with diabetes and hypertension who have COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: C-reactive protein may help to identify patients with diabetes who are at greater risk of dying during hospitalization. Older patients with diabetes were prone to death related to COVID-19. Attention needs to be paid to patients with diabetes and COVID-19 who use insulin. ACEI/ARB use showed no significant impact on patients with diabetes and hypertension who have COVID-19.","Diabetes Care","Chen, Yuchen","Yang, Dong","Cheng, Biao","Chen, Jian","Peng, Anlin","Yang, Chen","Liu, Chong","Xiong, Mingrui","Deng, Aiping","Zhang, Yu","Zheng, Ling","Huang, Kun","32409498"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: Diabetes is one of the most distinct comorbidities of COVID-19.

Results: 525 cases from 33 countries were reported (Median age 43 years, 53% men). Thirty-seven patients (7%) had severe COVID-19, 161 (31%) were hospitalized, and 16 patients died (3% case fatality rate).

Thirty-seven patients (7%) had severe COVID-19, 161 (31%) were hospitalized, and 16 patients died (3% case fatality rate). SMRs for IBD patients were 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-2.6), 1.5 (95% CI 0.7-2.2), and 1.7 (95% CI 0.9-2.5) relative to data from China, Italy, and the US, respectively. Risk factors for severe COVID-19 among IBD patients included increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.02), >/=2 comorbidities (aOR 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.8), systemic corticosteroids (aOR 6.9, 95% CI 2.3-20.5), and sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylate use (aOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3-7.7). TNF antagonist treatment was not associated with severe COVID-19 (aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.4-2.2). Conclusions: Increasing age, comorbidities, and corticosteroids are associated with severe COVID-19 among IBD patients, although a causal relationship cannot be definitively established. Notably, TNF antagonists do not appear to be associated with severe COVID-19."],"journal":"Gastroenterology","authors":["Brenner, Erica J","Ungaro, Ryan C","Gearry, Richard B","Kaplan, Gilaad G","Kissous-Hunt, Michele","Lewis, James D","Ng, Siew C","Rahier, Jean-Francois","Reinisch, Walter","Ruemmele, Frank M","Steinwurz, Flavio","Underwood, Fox E","Zhang, Xian","Colombel, Jean-Frederic","Kappelman, Michael D"],"date":"2020-05-20T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32425234","source":"PubMed","week":"202021|May 18 - May 24","doi":"10.1053/j.gastro.2020.05.032","keywords":["covid-19","crohn's disease","inflammatory bowel disease","ulcerative colitis"],"locations":["China","Italy","US","Associated"],"countries":["China","United States","Italy"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China","USA|United States","ITA|Italy"],"e_drugs":["Mesalamine","Sulfasalazine"],"topics":["Treatment","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1667252837665472512,"score":253.87999}]}
