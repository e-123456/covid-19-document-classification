PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with cancer at Sevier Valley Hospital in Richfield, Utah, were treated with a real-time video-based telehealth program under the care of an oncologist at a tertiary medical center. Data on financial savings, travel hours, mileage avoided, carbon emissions reduced, and revenue retained by Sevier Valley Hospital were collected from 2015 to 2018. RESULTS: From 2015 to 2018, 119 patients with cancer in Richfield, Utah, were treated with telehealth for oncology visits, accounting for 1,025 patient encounters. On average, patients saved 4 hours and 40 minutes and 332 miles roundtrip per encounter. In total, patients' savings were estimated to be $333,074. Carbon emissions were reduced by approximately 150,000 kg. Of new patient referrals, 59% were for solid tumors (70 of 119 referrals; 42 metastatic and 28 nonmetastatic cancers), and 41% were hematology consultations (49 of 119 referrals; 28 classical and 21 malignant hematologic conditions). We estimate that Sevier Valley Hospital retained $3,605,500 in revenue over this 4-year period. CONCLUSION: Using a telehealth program in rural Utah, patients with cancer benefited from substantial time and monetary savings. The local medical center was able to retain revenue it would have otherwise lost to outsourcing cancer care. Recent regulatory changes to address the COVID-19 pandemic should increase the number of patients with cancer treated via telehealth nationwide.","JCO Oncol Pract","Thota, Ramya","Gill, David M","Brant, Jamie L","Yeatman, Timothy J","Haslem, Derrick S","32463765"],"abstract":["PURPOSE: A telehealth oncology practice was created to care for patients in rural communities to improve access to health care, decrease financial burdens, and save time.

Measures of quality and barriers for rapid use by patients and physicians are not well described. OBJECTIVE: To describe results from a quality improvement initiative during rapid adoptive phase of telemedicine during the pandemic. DESIGN: Patient and physician satisfaction with synchronous audiovisual telemedicine visits was measured during early adoptive phase (April 6-17, 2020) within the division of sports medicine in an academic Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) department. Patients were invited to participate in a quality improvement initiative by completing an online survey at the end of a telemedicine visit. Physicians completed a separate survey. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient measures included visit type, duration of encounter, quality, and satisfaction. Physicians reported on experiences performing telemedicine. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 119 patients (289 telemedicine encounters, response rate 41%) and 13 physiatrists. Telemedicine was utilized primarily for follow-up visits (n=74, 70.6%) and most common duration was 15-29 minutes. Patients rated their telemedicine visit as \"excellent\" or \"very good\" across measures (91.6-95.0%) including addressing concerns, communication, developing a treatment plan, convenience, and satisfaction. Value of completing a future telemedicine visit was measured at 84.9%. Most reported estimated travel time saved in excess of 30 minutes. Rate of no-show was 2.8%. Most physicians (62%) had no prior experience with telemedicine visits, and most were comfortable performing these visits after completing 1-4 sessions (69%). Nearly all physicians (92%) rated their telemedicine experience as very good or excellent. The key barrier identified for telemedicine was technical issues. All physicians reported plans to perform telemedicine visits if reimbursement continues.
