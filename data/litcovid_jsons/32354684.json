DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A qualitative study with voluntary dyadic and focus group interviews with a total of 30 General Surgery residents enrolled at 2 academic medical centers in Boston, Massachusetts was conducted between March 12 to 16, 2020. RESULTS: The most commonly reported personal concern related to the COVID-19 outbreak was the health of their family (30 of 30 [100%]), followed by the risk of their transmitting COVID-19 infection to their family members (24 of 30 [80%]); risk of their transmitting COVID-19 infection their patients (19 of 30 [63%]); anticipated overwork for taking care of a high number of patients (15 of 30 [50%]); and risk of their acquiring COVID-19 infection from their patients (8 of 30 [27%]) .

These changes are particularly relevant to otolaryngology - head and neck surgery (OHNS) residents, as reports suggest an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 for otolaryngologists. The objectives of this study were to evaluate OHNS residency program practice changes and characterize resident perceptions during the initial phase of the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of U.S. OHNS residents at 81 programs was conducted between March 23-29, 2020. RESULTS: 82 residents from 51 institutions (63% of invited programs) responded. At time of survey, 98% of programs had enacted policy changes to minimize COVID-19 spread. These included filtered respirator use for aerosol-generating procedures even in COVID-19-negative patients (85%), decreased resident staffing of surgeries (70%), and reduced frequency of tracheotomy care (61%). The majority of residents (66%) perceived that residents were at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to attendings. Residents were most concerned about protective equipment shortage (93%) and transmitting COVID-19 to patients (90%). The majority of residents (73%) were satisfied with their department's COVID-19 response. Resident satisfaction correlated with comfort level in discussing concerns with attendings (r=0.72, p<0.00001) and inversely correlated with perceptions of increased risk compared to attendings (r=-0.52, p < 0.00001). CONCLUSION: U.S. OHNS residency programs implemented policy changes quickly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
