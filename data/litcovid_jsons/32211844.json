This study aims to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Patients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had improved/stabilized.

The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilization group (27.3% vs. 3.0%, chi = 9.291, P = 0.018). For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4] degrees C, U = 2.057, P = 0.027).

C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] vs. 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, U = 1.315, P = 0.024).

Patients in the death group had a significantly longer time of illness onset to hospitalization (10.0 [6.5, 12.0] days vs. 7.0 [5.0, 10.0] days, Z = 3.216, P = 0.001). On admission, the proportion of patients with symptoms of dyspnea (70.6% vs. 24.7%, chi = 60.905, P < 0.001) and expectoration (32.1% vs.15.7%, chi = 13.250, P < 0.001) was significantly higher. The blood oxygen saturation was significantly lower in the death group (85 [77, 91]% vs. 97 [95, 98]%, Z = 10.625, P < 0.001). The white blood cell (WBC) in death group was higher on admission (7.23 [4.87, 11.17] x 10/L vs. 4.52 [3.62, 5.88] x 10/L, Z = 7.618, P < 0.001). Patients in the death group exhibited significantly lower lymphocyte count (0.63 [0.40, 0.79] x 10/L vs. 1.00 [0.72, 1.27] x 10/L, Z = 8.037, P < 0.001) and lymphocyte/WBC ratio (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs. 23.5 [15.27, 31.25]%, Z = 10.315, P < 0.001) on admission, and the lymphocyte/WBC ratio continue to decrease during hospitalization (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs. 2.91 [1.79, 6.13]%, Z = 5.242, P < 0.001). Alanine transaminase (ALT) (22.00 [15.00, 34.00] U/L vs. 18.70 [13.00, 30.38] U/L, Z = 2.592, P = 0.010), aspartate transaminase (AST) (34.00 [27.00, 47.00] U/L vs. 22.00 [17.65, 31.75] U/L, Z = 7.308, P < 0.001), and creatinine levels (89.00 [72.00, 133.50] mumol/L vs.65.00 [54.60, 78.75] mumol/L, Z = 6.478, P < 0.001) were significantly higher in the death group that those in the recovered group. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also significantly higher in the death group on admission (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] mg/L vs.3.22 [1.04, 21.80] mg/L, Z = 10.206, P < 0.001) showed no significant improvement after treatment (109.25 [35.0, 170.28] mg/L vs. 81.60 [27.23, 179.08] mg/L, Z = 1.219, P = 0.233). The patients in the death group had more complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (89.9% vs. 7.6%, chi = 148.105, P < 0.001), acute cardiac injury (59.6% vs. 0.8%, chi = 93.222, P < 0.001), acute kidney injury (18.3% vs. 0, chi = 23.257, P < 0.001), shock (11.9% vs. 0, chi = 14.618, P < 0.001), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (6.4% vs. 0, chi = 7.655, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the recovered group, more patients in the death group exhibited characteristics of advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities, dyspnea, oxygen saturation decrease, increased WBC count, decreased lymphocytes, and elevated CRP levels. More patients in the death groups had complications such as ARDS, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, shock, and DIC.","Chin Med J (Engl)","Deng, Yan","Liu, Wei","Liu, Kui","Fang, Yuan-Yuan","Shang, Jin","Zhou, Ling","Wang, Ke","Leng, Fan","Wei, Shuang","Chen, Lei","Liu, Hui-Guo","32209890"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused the outbreak of the acute respiratory disease in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China since December 2019. This study is performed to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients who succumbed to and who recovered from 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS: Clinical data were collected from two tertiary hospitals in Wuhan. A retrospective investigation was conducted to analyze the clinical characteristics of fatal cases of COVID-19 (death group) and compare them with recovered patients (recovered group). Continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed by chi test or Fisher's exact tests as appropriate. RESULTS: Our study enrolled 109 COVID-19 patients who died during hospitalization and 116 recovered patients.
