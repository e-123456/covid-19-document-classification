This disease and its worldwide impact have sparked tremendous interest in the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical consequences of COVID-19. This accumulating body of evidence has centered around case series and often empiric therapies as controlled trials are just getting underway. What is clear is that patients appear to be at higher risk for thrombotic disease states including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), venous thromboembolism (VTE) such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), or stroke. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are also at higher risk for morbidity and mortality if infected. These patients are commonly treated with anticoagulation and/or antiplatelet medications and less commonly thrombolysis during hospitalization, potentially with great benefit but management of these medications can be difficult in potentially critically ill patients.In this paper, we review the current guidelines, consensus statements, and emerging evidence for a wide range of cardiovascular disease states with special focus on anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy. Our goal is to provide guidance for treatment of the cardiovascular patient with COVID-19 in the face of a rapidly evolving understanding of this virus and its complications.Preamble:Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies are a major cause of inpatient morbidity and mortality.
