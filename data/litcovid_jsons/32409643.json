METHODS: An online survey of patients in quarantine. Questions targeted the conditions of quarantine, sleep related behaviours and exposure to factors known to affect sleep and circadian rhythms (light exposure and sport). RESULTS: In all, 1777 participants were included: 77% women and 72% aged 25-54 years. Quarantine conditions were most frequently in couples with children (36%) and in a house with a garden (51%). Forty-seven percent of participants reported a decrease in sleep quality during quarantine. Factors associated with a reduction in sleep quality by logistic regression were sleep reduction (OR 15.52 P<0.001), going to bed later (OR 1.72 P<0.001), getting up earlier (2.18 P=0.01), an increase in sleep-wake irregularity (OR 2.29 P<0.001), reduced exposure to daylight (OR 1.46 P=0.01) and increased screen use in the evenings (OR 1.33 P=0.04). CONCLUSION: Sleep quality tended to reduce during quarantine and this was associated with changes in sleep behaviours and light exposure, especially in the evening. In order to optimise sleep during quarantine, regular sleep and wake times, at least 1hour exposure to daylight and a reduction of screen use in the evenings are suggested.","Encephale","Hartley, S","Colas des Francs, C","Aussert, F","Martinot, C","Dagneaux, S","Londe, V","Waldron, L","Royant-Parola, S","32475692"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVES: Explore the evolution of sleep during the SARS-CoV-2 quarantine period and define associated factors.
