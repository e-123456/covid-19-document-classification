OBJECTIVES: We compared the clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, CT images and treatment of COVID-19 patients from three different cities in China. METHODS: 476 patients were recruited from Jan 1 to Feb 15, 2020 at three hospitals in Wuhan, Shanghai and Anhui. Patients were divided into four groups according to age and into three groups (moderate, severe, and critical group) according to the fifth version of the guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of China on Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19.

Compared with severe and critical groups, there were more patients taking ACEI/ARB in moderate group. More patients had multiple lung lobe involvement and pleural effusion in the critical group as compared to moderate group. Compared with the moderate group, more patients received antiviral agents within first 4 days than in severe group, and more patients received antibiotics and corticosteriods in critical and severe groups.

There was a significant difference in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers usage among patients with different severities.

RESULTS: Compared with general COVID-19 patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature among fever cases, higher incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P<0.05). Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P<0.05). After adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission, and receive oxygen, expectorant and adjunctive agents (P<0.05) when considering the factors of disease severity on admission, mechanical ventilation, and ICU transfer. CONCLUSION: Nearly 50% COVID-19 patients could not reach obvious clinical and radiological remission within 10 days after hospitalization. The patients with male sex, anorexia and no fever on admission predicted poor efficacy."],"journal":"Clin Infect Dis","authors":["Mo, Pingzheng","Xing, Yuanyuan","Xiao, Yu","Deng, Liping","Zhao, Qiu","Wang, Hongling","Xiong, Yong","Cheng, Zhenshun","Gao, Shicheng","Liang, Ke","Luo, Mingqi","Chen, Tielong","Song, Shihui","Ma, Zhiyong","Chen, Xiaoping","Zheng, Ruiying","Cao, Qian","Wang, Fan","Zhang, Yongxi"],"date":"2020-03-17T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32173725","week":"202012|Mar 16 - Mar 22","doi":"10.1093/cid/ciaa270","keywords":["COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2","clinical efficacy","predictors"],"source":"PubMed","locations":["neutrophil","Wuhan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Treatment","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1663352133911576577,"score":312.49835}]}
