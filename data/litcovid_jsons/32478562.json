The purpose of this article is to systematically review and meta-analyze the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT in detecting coronavirus disease (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS. MEDLINE was systematically searched for publications on the diagnostic performance of chest CT in detecting COVID-19. Methodologic quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random-effects model. RESULTS. Six studies were included, comprising 1431 patients. All six studies included patients at high risk of COVID-19, and five studies explicitly reported that they included only symptomatic patients. Mean prevalence of COVID-19 was 47.9% (range, 27.6-85.4%). High or potential risk of bias was present throughout all QUADAS-2 domains in all six studies. Sensitivity ranged from 92.9% to 97.0%, and specificity ranged from 25.0% to 71.9%, with pooled estimates of 94.6% (95% CI, 91.9-96.4%) and 46.0% (95% CI, 31.9-60.7%), respectively.

Diagnostic accuracy studies on chest CT in COVID-19 suffer from methodologic quality issues.

We conducted a systematic review (PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE until April 25, 2020) and a proportion meta-analysis. We included seven studies examining the role of LUS in 122 COVID-19 patients. The pooled proportion (PP) of B-pattern detected by lung ultrasound (US) was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00 I (2) 0%, Q 4.6). The PP of finding pleural line abnormalities was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.13-1.00 I (2) 96%, Q 103.9), of pleural thickening was 0.54 (95% 0.11-0.95 I (2) 93%, Q 61.1), of subpleural or pulmonary consolidation was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.21-0.58 I (2) 72%, Q 17.8), and of pleural effusion was 0.14 (95% CI: 0.00-0.37 I (2) 93%, Q 27.3). Our meta-analysis revealed that almost all SARS-CoV-2-infected patients have abnormal lung US. The most common abnormality is interstitial involvement depicted as B-pattern. The finding from our review highlights the potential role of this modality in the triage, diagnosis, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients. A sizable diagnostic accuracy study comparing LUS, computed tomography scan, and COVID-19-specific tests is warranted to further test this finding and to delineate the diagnostic and prognostic yield of each of these modalities."],"journal":"Am J Trop Med Hyg","authors":["Mohamed, Mouhand F H","Al-Shokri, Shaikha","Yousaf, Zohaib","Danjuma, Mohammed","Parambil, Jessiya","Mohamed, Samreen","Mubasher, Mahmood","Dauleh, Mujahed M","Hasanain, Bara","AlKahlout, Mohamed Awni","Abubeker, Ibrahim Y"],"date":"2020-06-06T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32500849","source":"PubMed","week":"202023|Jun 01 - Jun 07","doi":"10.4269/ajtmh.20-0371","locations":["US","US","Symptomatic"],"countries":["United States"],"countries_codes":["USA|United States"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1668804508693561345,"score":252.80936}]}
