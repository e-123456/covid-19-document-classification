Median age at diagnosis was 71.0 +/- 12.8 years, and the median interval since transplantation was 9.3 years. Fever (83.3%) and radiographic abnormalities in form of unilateral or bilateral/multifocal consolidations (72.2%) were the most common presentations. Lopinavir/ritonavir (usually associated with hydroxychloroquine [HCQ]) was used in 50.0% of patients, and had to be prematurely discontinued in two of them. Other antiviral regimens included HCQ monotherapy (27.8%) and interferon-beta (16.7%). As of April 4, the case fatality rate was 27.8% (5/18). After a median follow-up of 18 days from symptom onset, 30.8% (4/13) of survivors developed progressive respiratory failure, 7.7% (1/13) showed stable clinical condition or improvement, and 61.5% (8/13) had been discharged home.
