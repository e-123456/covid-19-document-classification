We aimed to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with cancer and COVID-19, and examined risk factors for mortality in this population. METHODS: We did a retrospective, multicentre, cohort study of 205 patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and with a pathological diagnosis of a malignant tumour in nine hospitals within Hubei, China, from Jan 13 to March 18, 2020.

Clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and cancer histories were compared between survivors and non-survivors by use of chi(2) test. Risk factors for mortality were identified by univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. FINDINGS: Between Jan 13 and Mar 18, 2020, 205 patients with cancer and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled (median age 63 years [IQR 56-70; range 14-96]; 109 [53%] women). 183 (89%) had solid tumours and 22 (11%) had haematological malignancies.

Case fatality rates were 62% (32, 85%) and 0 (0, 32%; P = 0.002). Hospitalised persons with haematological cancers have a similar case rate of COVID-19 compared with normal health care providers but have more severe disease and a higher case fatality rate. Because we were unable to identify specific risk factors for COVID-19 in hospitalised persons with haematological cancers, we suggest increased surveillance and possible protective isolation."],"journal":"Leukemia","authors":["He, Wenjuan","Chen, Lei","Chen, Li","Yuan, Guolin","Fang, Yun","Chen, Wenlan","Wu, Di","Liang, Bo","Lu, Xiaoting","Ma, Yanling","Li, Lei","Wang, Hongxiang","Chen, Zhichao","Li, Qiubai","Gale, Robert Peter"],"date":"2020-04-26T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32332856","source":"PubMed","week":"202017|Apr 20 - Apr 26","doi":"10.1038/s41375-020-0836-7","locations":["Wuhan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Prevention"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138493963730944,"score":155.2309}]}
