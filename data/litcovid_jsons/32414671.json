METHODS: We performed an internet-based survey among Presidents and Members of the Societies of the Latin American Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (FLANC). We blindly analyzed information about local conditions and their impact on neurosurgical praxis using SPSS(R) software. RESULTS: Information came from 21 countries. Sixteen Society Presidents reported having suspended regular activities, and differing local scheduled congresses, fourteen reported mandatory isolation by government, and four instituted a telemedicine project. Four-hundred eighty-six colleagues, mean age 49 years, reported a mean 79% reduction in their neurosurgical praxis. Seventy-six percent of neurosurgeons had savings to self-support for 3-6 months, if restrictions are long lasting. CONCLUSIONS: Stopping activities among Societies of the FLANC, together with a drop of 79% of neurosurgical praxis, adds to deficits in provider s protection equipment and increasing demand for attention in the healthcare systems; representing a huge financial risk for their sustainability. Neurosurgeons should involve in local policies to protect health and economy. Telemedicine represents an excellent solution, avoiding another pandemic of severe diseases across all-specialties as non-essential care can turn essential if left untreated. Financial support and ethics code review is needed to battle this new disease, designated the occupational disease of the decade, that continues to struggle the healthcare systems. Times of crisis are times of great opportunities for humanity to evolve.","World Neurosurg","Jose Antonio, Soriano Sanchez","Tito, Perilla","Marcelo, Zenteno","Alvaro, Campero","Claudio, Yampolsky","Mauro, Loyo Varela","Manuel Eduardo, Soto Garcia","Jose Alberto Israel, Romero Rangel","32389878"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe economic consequences by local governmental measures to contain the outbreak(1) We provide insight on the impact that healthcare restriction has made on neurosurgical activity in Latin Iberoamerica.

OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study are to report the load and variety of emergent/urgent neurosurgical cases after implementing the 'Battle Plan' at an academic tertiary referral center during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare these variables to previous practice at the same institution. METHODS: The clinical data of all patients who underwent a neurosurgical intervention between March 23, 2020 and April 20, 2020 was obtained from a prospectively maintained database. Data of the control group was retrospectively collected from the medical records to compare the types of surgeries/interventions performed by the same neurosurgical service before the COVID-19 pandemic started. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients underwent emergent, urgent and essential neurosurgical interventions over a 4-week period during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient screening at teleclinics identified 11 urgent surgical cases. The implementation of the 'Battle Plan' led to a significant decrease in the case load, and the variation of cases by subspecialty is evident when compared to a control group comprised of 214 patients. CONCLUSION: Delivery of optimal care and safe practice and education at an academic neurosurgical department can be well maintained with proper execution of crisis protocols. Teleclinics proved to be efficient in screening patients for urgent neurosurgical conditions, but in-person clinic visits may still be necessary for some cases in the immediate postoperative period.","World Neurosurg","Noureldine, Mohammad Hassan A","Pressman, Elliot","Krafft, Paul R","Greenberg, Mark S","Agazzi, Siviero","van Loveren, Harry","Alikhani, Puya","32450314"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical services are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and several departments reported their experiences and responses to the COVID-19 crisis in an attempt to provide insights from which other impacted departments can benefit.
