Here, we report about our local experience in a region with high COVID-19 prevalence and dynamically increasing infection rates. Methods: Within the 8-d period of March 16-24, 2020, hybrid imaging studies of asymptomatic patients who underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT or (131)I SPECT/CT for standard oncologic indications at our institution in Brescia, Italy, were analyzed for findings suggestive of COVID-19. The presence, radiologic features, and metabolic activity of interstitial pneumonia were identified, correlated with the subsequent short-term clinical course, and described in a case series. Results: Six of 65 patients (9%) who underwent PET/CT for various malignancies showed unexpected signs of interstitial pneumonia on CT and elevated regional (18)F-FDG avidity. Additionally, 1 of 12 patients who received radioiodine for differentiated thyroid carcinoma also showed interstitial pneumonia on SPECT/CT. Five of 7 patients had subsequent proof of COVID-19 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The remaining 2 patients were not tested immediately but underwent quarantine and careful monitoring.

We reviewed the scans, collected medical history, and exposure information. RESULTS: Among the 13 scans, we identified 5 cases with imaging findings suspicious for viral infection. Peripheral lung consolidations and/or ground-glass opacities in two or more lobes were found. Lung abnormalities displayed increased [18F]FDG uptake (SUVmax 4.3-11.3). All the patients on the day of PET/CT acquisition were asymptomatic, and they did not have fever or cough. In view of the PET/CT findings, home isolation, symptom surveillance, and treatment (in 3/5 patients) were indicated. At 1-week follow-up, 2/5 patients experienced the onset of mild respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The [18F]FDG-PET/CT can identify probable Covid-19 disease in the absence or before symptoms onset and can guide patient management. Nuclear medicine staff needs to be aware of the possibility of contact with patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection even if they do not present any symptom.
