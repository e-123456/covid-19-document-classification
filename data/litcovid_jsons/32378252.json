COVID-19 is the name given to the disease associated with the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus not been previously identified in humans. METHODS: Two key factors, case incidence and case morbidity were analysed for England. When taken together they give an estimate of relative demand on healthcare utilisation. To analyse case incidence, the latest values for indicators that could be associated with infection transmission rates were collected from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) sources. These included population density, %age>16, at fulltime work/education, %age over 60, %BME ethnicity, social deprivation as IMD2019, location as latitude/longitude, and patient engagement as %self-confident in their own long-term condition management. Average case morbidity was calculated. To provide a comparative measure of overall healthcare resource impact, individual GP practice impact scores were compared against the median practice. RESULTS: The case incidence regression is a dynamic situation but it currently shows that Urban, %Working and age>60 were the strongest determinants of case incidence. The local population comorbidity remains unchanged. The range of relative healthcare impact was wide with 80% of practices falling at 20%-250% of the national median. Once practice population numbers were included we found that the top 33% of GP practices supporting 45% of the patient population would require 68% of COVID-19 healthcare resources.

CONCLUSION: Covid-19 is impacting on the utilisation of health/social care resources across the world.

We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R0, the average number of secondary cases generated per case). METHODS: We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The questionnaire was conducted online via email recruitment and documents the age and location of contacts and a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday, 24 March, 1 day after a \"lockdown\" was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the \"lockdown\" to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place. RESULTS: We found a 74% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.8 to 2.8). This would be sufficient to reduce R0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22-0.53) for physical (skin to skin) contacts only. CONCLUSIONS: The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease, and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported.
