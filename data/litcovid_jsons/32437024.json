This review was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of CPT therapy in COVID-19 patients based on the publications reported till date. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on convalescent plasma on clinically relevant outcomes in individuals with COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE and Medline databases were searched upto 19 April 2020. All records were screened as per the protocol eligibility criteria. RESULTS: We included 5 studies reporting CPT to COVID-19 patients. The main findings from available data are as follows: (1) Convalescent plasma may reduce mortality in critically ill patients (2) Increase in neutralizing antibody titers and disappearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed in almost all the patients after CPT therapy (3) Beneficial effect on clinical symptoms after administration of convalescent plasma. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the limited scientific data, CPT therapy in COVID-19 patient appears safe, clinically effective and reduces mortality. Well-designed large multi center clinical trial studies should be conducted urgently to establish the efficacy of CPT to COVID-19 patients. This article is protected by copyright.
