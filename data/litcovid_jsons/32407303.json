The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing cycle threshold (Ct) values indicated large quantities of viral RNA in asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic residents, suggesting the potential for transmission regardless of symptoms. Symptom-based screening in SNFs could fail to identify approximately half of residents with COVID-19. Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 (3). Once a confirmed case is identified in an SNF, all residents should be placed on isolation precautions if possible (3), with considerations for extended use or reuse of personal protective equipment (PPE) as needed (4)."],"journal":"MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep","authors":["Kimball, Anne","Hatfield, Kelly M","Arons, Melissa","James, Allison","Taylor, Joanne","Spicer, Kevin","Bardossy, Ana C","Oakley, Lisa P","Tanwar, Sukarma","Chisty, Zeshan","Bell, Jeneita M","Methner, Mark","Harney, Josh","Jacobs, Jesica R","Carlson, Christina M","McLaughlin, Heather P","Stone, Nimalie","Clark, Shauna","Brostrom-Smith, Claire","Page, Libby C","Kay, Meagan","Lewis, James","Russell, Denny","Hiatt, Brian","Gant, Jessica","Duchin, Jeffrey S","Clark, Thomas A","Honein, Margaret A","Reddy, Sujan C","Jernigan, John A"],"date":"2020-04-03T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32240128","source":"PubMed","week":"202014|Mar 30 - Apr 05","doi":"10.15585/mmwr.mm6913e1","locations":["King County","Washington","King County","Washington","Washington"],"countries":["United States"],"countries_codes":["USA|United States"],"topics":["Prevention","Transmission","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138490270646272,"score":297.25433}]}
