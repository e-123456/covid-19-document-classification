The main manifestations were fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, normal or leukopenia in peripheral blood and changes in chest CT and in severe cases, multiple organ failure might occur. The National Health Commission, PRC has revised the consensus on diagnosis and treatment seven times in a short period of time, indicating the growing understanding of the disease. Patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia usually had history of travelling or living in the epidemic area including Wuhan within 14 days before onset, or have been exposed to patients who had fever or respiratory symptoms from the epidemic area, or had clustering diseases. However, novel coronavirus pneumonia was becoming more and more blurred after vanishing epidemic. The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia was facing challenges not only because of large number of tourists increasing dramatically after the relieving of epidemic, but also patients with other diseases return from different areas to search for medical care. In this article, the clinical and chest imaging features of the novel coronavirus pneumonia were reviewed and compared with other infections and non-infectious diffuse pulmonary diseases. We were trying to find the similarities and differences among them, and to identify clues to the diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia, so as to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment.","Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi","Tian, X L","Peng, M","Wang, H P","Cai, B Q","Xu, W B","Zhu, Y J","Li, T S","Zhu, H D","Song, L","Wang, M Z","Zhang, L","Shi, J H","32153167"],"abstract":["Novel coronavirus pneumonia was novel coronavirus infection that has dominated pulmonary infection since December 2019.
