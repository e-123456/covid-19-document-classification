METHODS: We describe the key considerations of policies and processes that have been implemented in our nuclear medicine service since the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Singapore General Hospital on 23 January 2020, up to the present time. RESULTS: Infection control, screening of patients and visitors, segregation of risk groups, segregation of staff and service continuity plans, communication and staff welfare, using electronic platforms for multi-disciplinary meetings and tele-reporting are discussed. CONCLUSION: Since our hospital received the first patient with COVID-19 in Singapore, our centre has managed 16 COVID-19 cases to date. There has not been any healthcare worker in our institution who has contracted COVID-19 through patient contact.

Here, we report about our local experience in a region with high COVID-19 prevalence and dynamically increasing infection rates. Methods: Within the 8 day period of March 16-24, 2020, hybrid imaging studies of asymptomatic patients who underwent (18)F-FDG-PET/CT or (131)I-SPECT/CT for standard oncologic indications at our institution in Brescia, Italy, were analyzed for findings suggestive of COVID-19. Presence, radiological features and metabolic activity of interstitial pneumonia were identified, correlated with subsequent short-term clinical course and described in a case series. Results: Six of 65 patients (9%) that underwent PET/CT for various malignancies showed unexpected signs of interstitial pneumonia on CT and elevated regional FDG-avidity. Additionally, 1 of 12 patients who received radioiodine for differentiated thyroid carcinoma also showed interstitial pneumonia on SPECT/CT. 5/7 patients had subsequent proof of COVID-19 by RT-PCR. The remaining 2 patients were not tested immediately but underwent quarantine and careful monitoring.
