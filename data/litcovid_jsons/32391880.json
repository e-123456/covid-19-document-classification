The tumor board activity was measured from tumor board sheets extracted from the oncologic electronic file between January 7, 2019 and April 24, 2020. The pre-containment activity was compared to the activity of the containment periods but also to the equivalent periods in 2019. The number of meetings held, the average number of files reviewed per meeting including first presentations and the average number of physicians' attendance were the evaluation criteria. The study covered 191 TB that held 3,943 multidisciplinary team meetings (MTM) and reviewed 72070 files (including 30127 first submissions). There was a moderate decrease of 8 % in the number of meetings after March 16, 2020. The number of files examined decreased by 23 % in the following month and even more by 33 % in the third period. The physicians' number who attended MTM also decreased by 25 %. The negative impact was higher in the Mediterranean part of the region. This first study of tumor board activity, covering a large region but little affected by the pandemic, shows that its impact on the participation to the MTM has been moderate. In addition, tumor boards have followed the recommendations for optimizing quorum. However, the decrease in average MTM activity, particularly for first submissions, suggests a potential delay in patient management. Complementary qualitative and quantitative works are warranted to estimate the real impact on carcinologic outcomes.","Bull Cancer","Grosclaude, Pascale","Azria, David","Guimbaud, Rosine","Thibault, Severine","Daubisse, Laetitia","Cartron, Guillaume","Renaudie, Marie-Jose","Dalbies, Pierre-Adrien","Delord, Jean-Pierre","Bauvin, Eric","32425210"],"abstract":["This work examines the impact of the SARS-CoV2 epidemic and the organizational recommendations that have been issued since March 16 on tumor boards (TB) activity.
