OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to explore risk factors of mortality and ICU admission in COVID-19 patients using combined CT and clinicolaboratory data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19 (N= 63) from University Hospitals in Tehran, Iran were studied. All patients underwent CT examination and a total CT score and the number of involved lung lobes were calculated and compared against collected laboratory and clinical information. Univariable and multivariate proportional hazards analysis were used to determine the relationship between the CT, laboratory and clinical data and ICU admission and in-hospital death. RESULTS: By univariable analysis, in-hospital mortality was higher in patients with lower O2 saturation on admission (<88%), higher CT scores and higher number of lung lobes (> 4) involved with a diffuse parenchymal pattern. By multivariable analysis, in-hospital mortality was higher in patients with O2 saturation below 88% on admission and a higher number of lung lobes involved with diffuse parenchymal pattern. The risk of ICU admission was higher with comorbidities (hypertension and ischemic heart disease), SaO2 below 88% and pericardial effusion.
