All U.S. states have advised their cystic fibrosis (CF) populations to socially isolate. Major health care payors such as Medicare and most private insurance companies have agreed to reimburse health care providers for telemedicine and telephone visits. Methods: The CF adult team at the University of Virginia (UVA) transitioned from face-to-face clinics to multidisciplinary telemedicine clinics by using WebEx((R)) (Cisco Systems, San Jose, CA), a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) compliant platform. Interventions: Patients were contacted before scheduled visits and triaged into: (1) patients eligible for the multidisciplinary telemedicine clinic, (2) patients to be seen in clinic urgently due to acute needs, and (3) stable patients who can be rescheduled at a later time. Ineligible patients for the telemedicine clinic due to lack of access to technology were followed up via telephone. Results: A total of 63 patients were scheduled to be seen in the UVA clinic over 4 weeks, 10 clinic days. Of these patients, 20 (32%) rescheduled their appointment. In addition, 2 patients (3%) were seen in clinic for acute needs and 38 (60%) were seen by the multidisciplinary team through telemedicine. Conclusions: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, implementing a telemedicine clinic process that serves the needs of a multidisciplinary care team is paramount to preserving the CF care model. Through a systematic design and test process, a feasible and sustainable program was created that can be utilized by other multidisciplinary programs to adapt to their context.","Telemed J E Health","Compton, Martina","Soper, Morgan","Reilly, Bonnie","Gettle, Lucy","List, Rhonda","Bailey, Molly","Bruschwein, Heather","Somerville, Lindsay","Albon, Dana","32357084"],"abstract":["Introduction: The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a major world health problem.
