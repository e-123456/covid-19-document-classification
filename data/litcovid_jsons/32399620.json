Laboratory parameters were retrospectively collected from medical records. Severity of lung changes on chest CT of early, progressive, peak, and absorption stages was scored according to the percentage of lung involvement (5 lobes, scores 1-5 for each lobe, range 0-20). Relationship between CT scores and laboratory parameters was evaluated by the Spearman rank correlation. The Bonferroni correction adjusted significance level was at 0.05/4 = 0.0125. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients (mean age, 47.8 +/- 12.0 years [standard deviation]; age range, 24-80 years) were evaluated. The patients underwent a total of 339 chest CT scans with a median interval of 4 days (interquartile range, 3-5 days). Median chest CT scores peaked at 4 days after the beginning of treatment and then declined. CT score of the early stage was correlated with neutrophil count (r = 0.531, P = 0.011).
