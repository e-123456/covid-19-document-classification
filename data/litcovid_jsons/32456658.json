Most of the literature showed that the elevated liver enzymes in COVID-19 are of little clinical significance. Lower albumin level is seen in severe COVID-19 and is not parallel to the changes in ALT and AST levels. We aimed to explore the impact of hypoalbuminemia in COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with confirmed COVID-19. The relationship between hypoalbuminemia and death was studied using binary logistic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 299 adult patients were included, 160 (53.5%) were males and the average age was 53.4 +/- 16.7 years. The median time from the onset of illness to admission was 3 days (interquartile ranges 2-5). Approximately one-third of patients had comorbidities. Hypoalbuminemia (<35g/L) was found in 106 (35.5%) patients. The difference in albumin was considerable between survivors and non-survivors (37.6 +/- 6.2 vs. 30.5 +/- 4.0, P < 0.001). Serum albumin level was inversely correlated to white blood cell (r = -0.149, P = 0.01) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (r = -0.298, P <0.001). Multivariate analysis showed the presence of comorbidities (OR = 6.816, 95%CI: 1.361-34.133), lymphopenia (OR = 13.130, 95%CI: 1.632-105.658) and hypoalbuminemia (OR = 6.394, 95%CI: 1.315-31.092) were independent predictive factors for mortality.
