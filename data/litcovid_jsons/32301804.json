METHODS: The clinical data of 48 patients with suspected COVID-19 admitted in Jinhua Central Hospital from January 21, 2020 to March 20, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 48 suspected cases, 18 were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 30 were excluded. Each of the confirmed cases were discussed among MDT for 2 to 12 times with an average of (4.7+/-3.2) times; while for non-COVID-19 patients were discussed for 2 to 4 times with an average of (2.3+/-0.6) times per case. With the guidance of MDT, one COVID-19 patient was transferred to designated provincial hospital after effective treatment; one patient complicated with acute cholecystitis underwent gallbladder puncture and drainage; and COVID-19 was excluded in a highly suspected patient after alveolar lavage fluid examination. Except one transferred patient, all 17 confirmed COVID-19 patients were cured and discharged; there was no cross-infection occurred in suspected patients during the hospitalization; there were no deaths and no medical staff infections. CONCLUSIONS: The efficiency of diagnosis and treatment for suspected COVID-19 patients can be improved under MDT mode, particularly for complicated and refractory cases.","Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban","Ding, Shubo","Yu, Shi'an","Chen, Haijun","Zhang, Dehe","Xu, Yejin","Zhu, Dan","Cheng, Kun","32275128"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To analyze the roles of multidisciplinary team (MDT) in the diagnosis and treatment of suspected cases of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
