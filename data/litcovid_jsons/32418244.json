METHODS: In early March 2020, the first cases of COVID-19 were announced in the United States.

RESULTS: Over time, our program has successfully rolled out initiatives to service the growing number of COVID-related inpatients while maintaining neurologic care for those in need and continuing our neurologic education curriculum.
