Per infection prevention guidelines, and hospital codes, catheterization and electrophysiology laboratories are usually built as positive pressure ventilation rooms to minimize the infection risk. However, patients with highly transmissible airborne diseases such as COVID-19 are best cared in negative ventilation rooms to minimize the risk of transmission. From mechanical and engineering perspective, positive pressure ventilation rooms cannot be readily converted to negative pressure ventilation rooms.
