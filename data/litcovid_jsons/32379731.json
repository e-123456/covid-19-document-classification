SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is primarily spread person to person through respiratory droplets. Nationwide, the meat and poultry processing industry, an essential component of the U.S. food infrastructure, employs approximately 500,000 persons, many of whom work in proximity to other workers (1). Because of reports of initial cases of COVID-19, in some meat processing facilities, states were asked to provide aggregated data concerning the number of meat and poultry processing facilities affected by COVID-19 and the number of workers with COVID-19 in these facilities, including COVID-19-related deaths. Qualitative data gathered by CDC during on-site and remote assessments were analyzed and summarized. During April 9-27, aggregate data on COVID-19 cases among 115 meat or poultry processing facilities in 19 states were reported to CDC. Among these facilities, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 4,913 (approximately 3%) workers, and 20 COVID-19-related deaths were reported. Facility barriers to effective prevention and control of COVID-19 included difficulty distancing workers at least 6 feet (2 meters) from one another (2) and in implementing COVID-19-specific disinfection guidelines.* Among workers, socioeconomic challenges might contribute to working while feeling ill, particularly if there are management practices such as bonuses that incentivize attendance. Methods to decrease transmission within the facility include worker symptom screening programs, policies to discourage working while experiencing symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and social distancing by workers. Source control measures (e.g., the use of cloth face covers) as well as increased disinfection of high-touch surfaces are also important means of preventing SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Mitigation efforts to reduce transmission in the community should also be considered. Many of these measures might also reduce asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission (3). Implementation of these public health strategies will help protect workers from COVID-19 in this industry and assist in preserving the critical meat and poultry production infrastructure (4).","MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep","Dyal, Jonathan W","Grant, Michael P","Broadwater, Kendra","Bjork, Adam","Waltenburg, Michelle A","Gibbins, John D","Hale, Christa","Silver, Maggie","Fischer, Marc","Steinberg, Jonathan","Basler, Colin A","Jacobs, Jesica R","Kennedy, Erin D","Tomasi, Suzanne","Trout, Douglas","Hornsby-Myers, Jennifer","Oussayef, Nadia L","Delaney, Lisa J","Patel, Ketki","Shetty, Varun","Kline, Kelly E","Schroeder, Betsy","Herlihy, Rachel K","House, Jennifer","Jervis, Rachel","Clayton, Joshua L","Ortbahn, Dustin","Austin, Connie","Berl, Erica","Moore, Zack","Buss, Bryan F","Stover, Derry","Westergaard, Ryan","Pray, Ian","DeBolt, Meghan","Person, Amy","Gabel, Julie","Kittle, Theresa S","Hendren, Pamela","Rhea, Charles","Holsinger, Caroline","Dunn, John","Turabelidze, George","Ahmed, Farah S","deFijter, Siestke","Pedati, Caitlin S","Rattay, Karyl","Smith, Erica E","Luna-Pinto, Carolina","Cooley, Laura A","Saydah, Sharon","Preacely, Nykiconia D","Maddox, Ryan A","Lundeen, Elizabeth","Goodwin, Bradley","Karpathy, Sandor E","Griffing, Sean","Jenkins, Mary M","Lowry, Garry","Schwarz, Rachel D","Yoder, Jonathan","Peacock, Georgina","Walke, Henry T","Rose, Dale A","Honein, Margaret A","32379731"],"abstract":["Congregate work and residential locations are at increased risk for infectious disease transmission including respiratory illness outbreaks.

The results reveal that, firstly, based on their food health and risk perceptions of healthy and risky food, the respondents' general attitudes are positive toward organic food but relatively negative toward game meat. Secondly, older generations have a more positive attitude and are more committed to organic food. Younger generations' attitude toward game meat is more negative whereas older generations attach more importance to it because of its nutritional and medicinal values.
