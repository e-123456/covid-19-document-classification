OBJECTIVES: To query the international spinal cord medicine community's engagement with and response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and to assess pandemic-specific information needs and patient concerns. SETTING: An international collaboration of authors and participants. METHODS: Two near-identical surveys (one English and one Spanish language) were distributed via the internet. Responses from those questions shared between the surveys were pooled then analyzed; four questions' responses (those not shared) were analyzed separately. RESULTS: A total of 783 responses were submitted from six continents. Few participants (5.8%) had tested their outpatients with SCI/D for COVID-19; only 4.4% reported having a patient with SCI/D with the virus. Of respondents who worked at an inpatient facility, 53.3% reported that only individuals with symptoms were being screened and 29.9% said that no screening was occurring. Participants relayed several concerns offered by their patients with SCI/D, including vulnerability to infection (76.9%) and fragility of caretaker supply (42%), and those living in countries with guaranteed health care were more likely to report widespread availability of COVID-19 testing than were those living in countries without universal care, chi(2) (3, N = 625) = 46.259, p < 0.001. CONCLUSION: There is substantial variability in the rehabilitation medicine community in COVID-19 screening practices and availability of screening kits. People living with SCI/D are expressing legitimate and real concerns about their vulnerability to COVID-19. More and rapid work is needed to address these concerns and to standardize best-practice protocols throughout the rehabilitation community.","Spinal Cord Ser Cases","Stillman, Michael D","Capron, Maclain","Alexander, Marcalee","Di Giusto, Melina Longoni","Scivoletto, Giorgio","32296046"],"abstract":["STUDY DESIGN: An online survey.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old male with AIS A C4 tetraplegia developed fever during the night, without any prodrome. His general practitioner suspected a urinary tract infection and prescribed him antibiotic therapy. After 2 days of antibiotic therapy the fever still persisted, so the individual was admitted to the local hospital and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. After 2 days he was transferred to our spinal unit. Considering the worsening of the chest X-ray and fever despite 48 h of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, we strongly suspected viral pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 was detected and antiviral therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir, associated with hydroxychloroquine, was promptly started. Fever ceased after 2 days of therapy. DISCUSSION: Blood test and chest X-ray findings in this patient were similar to previously published findings regarding COVID-19. One difference between this case and the known clinical course of COVID-19 is that did not develop cough. Another interesting feature of our case is that, despite tetraplegia, the clinical course was not severe. Persons with COVID-19 remain asymptomatic, these results underscore the need for rehabilitation and SCI professionals to have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in their inpatient and outpatient clients. Only inpatient with fever hase being tested for COVID-19. All new patients are submitted to SARS-COV-2 Test. Moreover, routine testing of patients who have to participate in therapy in common gym areas may be warranted.","Spinal Cord Ser Cases","Righi, Gabriele","Del Popolo, Giulio","32303672"],"abstract":["INTRODUCTION: We present the report of the first, to our best knowledge, case of COVID-19 in a tetraplegic person.
