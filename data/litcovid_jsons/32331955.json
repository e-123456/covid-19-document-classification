The incidence of acute cardiac injury was about 13 folds higher in ICU/severe patients compared with the non-ICU/severe patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with previous cardiovascular metabolic diseases may face a greater risk of developing into the severe condition and the comorbidities can also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 can, in turn, aggravate the damage to the heart."],"journal":"Clin Res Cardiol","authors":["Li, Bo","Yang, Jing","Zhao, Faming","Zhi, Lili","Wang, Xiqian","Liu, Lin","Bi, Zhaohui","Zhao, Yunhe"],"date":"2020-03-13T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32161990","week":"202011|Mar 09 - Mar 15","doi":"10.1007/s00392-020-01626-9","keywords":["2019-ncov","covid-19","cardiac injury","cardiovascular metabolic diseases"],"source":"PubMed","topics":["Mechanism","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"locations":["China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"_version_":1664640874785538048,"score":458.34406},{"pmid":32315733,"title":"Elevated troponin in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): possible mechanisms.","text":["Elevated troponin in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): possible mechanisms.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has affected more than 1.8 million people worldwide, overwhelmed health care systems due to the high proportion of critical presentations, and resulted in over 100,000 deaths.
