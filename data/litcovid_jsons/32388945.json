Whether rich or poor, all nations are struggling to cope with this new global health crisis. The speed of the threat's emergence and the quick response required from public health authorities and the public itself makes evident the need for a major reform in pandemic surveillance and notification systems. The development and implementation of a graded, individual-level, pandemic notification system could be an effective tool to combat future threats of epidemics. This paper describes a prototype model of such a notification system and its potential advantages and challenges for implementation. Similar to other emergency alerts, this system would include a number of threat levels (e.g., Level 1-5) with a higher level indicating increasing severity and intensity of safety measures (e.g., Level 1: General Hygiene, Level 2: Enhanced Hygiene, Level 3: Physical Distancing, Level 4: Shelter in Place, and Level 5: Lockdown). The notification would be disseminated to cellular devices via text message (for lower threat levels) and push notification (for higher threat levels). It would allow the public to be informed about the threat level in real-time and act accordingly in an organized manner. New Zealand and the United Kingdom have recently launched similar alert systems designed to coordinate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic response more efficiently. Implementing such a system, however, faces multiple challenges. Extensive preparation and coordination among all levels of government and relevant sectors are required.

This educational component is of utmost importance to minimize adverse public reaction and unintended consequences. The use of mass media and local communities could be considered where mobile phone penetration is low. The implementation of such a notification system would be more challenging in developing countries for several reasons, including inadequate technology, limited use of data plans, high population density, poverty, mistrust in government, and tendency to ignore and/or failure to understand the warning messages.
