Different drugs for prophylaxis against COVID-19 including chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been tried. This study was performed to systematically review the role of CQ and HCQ in preventing the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies that evaluated the prophylactic role of CQ or HCQ on SARS-CoV-2 (pre-clinical studies) or COVID-19 (clinical studies) until 30 March 2020. The available literature was critically appraised. RESULTS: A total of 45 articles were screened and five (three in vitro pre-clinical studies and two clinical opinions) were included. The pre-clinical studies showed the prophylactic effects of CQ and HCQ against SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, the clinical opinions advocated the prophylactic use of CQ and HCQ against COVID-19. However, no original clinical studies on the prophylactic role of CQ or HCQ on COVID-19 were available. CONCLUSION: Although pre-clinical results are promising, till date, there is dearth of evidence to support the efficacy of CQ or HCQ in preventing COVID-19. Considering potential safety issues and the likelihood of imparting a false sense of security, prophylaxis with CQ or HCQ against COVID-19 needs to be thoroughly evaluated in observational studies or high quality randomized controlled studies.","Int J Rheum Dis","Shah, Sanket","Das, Saibal","Jain, Avinash","Misra, Durga Prasanna","Negi, Vir Singh","32281213"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: The pandemic Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) has pushed the global healthcare system to a crisis and amounted to a huge economic burden.
