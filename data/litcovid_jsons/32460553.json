METHODS: Retrospective cohort of 103 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Demographic data, past medical history and hospital course were collected and analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was implemented to examine associations. RESULTS: From February 17th to April 5th, 103 consecutive patients were hospitalized with COVID-19.

In a multivariate analysis, severe obesity (BMI >/=35 kg/m2) was associated with ICU admission (aOR 5.39; 95% CI:1.13-25.64). Moreover, patients who required IMV, were more likely to have had heart disease (aOR 3.41; 95% CI:1.05-11.06), obesity (BMI=30-34.9 kg/m2) (aOR 6.85; 95% CI: 1.05-44.82) or severe obesity (BMI>/=35 kg/m2) (aOR 9.99; 95% CI:1.39-71.69).

METHODS: We obtained data of confirmed and negative COVID-19 cases and their demographic and health characteristics from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of Mexican Ministry of Health. We investigated specific risk factors associated to COVID-19 positivity and mortality and explored the impact of diabetes and obesity on modifying COVID-19 related lethality.

Risk factors for lethality in COVID-19 include early-onset diabetes, obesity, COPD, advanced age, hypertension, immunosuppression, and CKD; we observed that obesity mediates 49.5% of the effect of diabetes on COVID-19 lethality. Early-onset diabetes conferred an increased risk of hospitalization and obesity conferred an increased risk for ICU admission and intubation.
