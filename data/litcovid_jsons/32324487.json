The objective of this study is to investigate the short-term effect of risk-adapted treatment strategy on patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We collected the medical records of 55 COVID-19 patients for analysis. We divided these patients into mild, moderate and severe groups, and risk-adapted treatment approaches were given according to the illness severity. RESULTS: Twelve patients were in mild group and 22 were in moderate group (non-severe group, n=34), and 21 patients were in severe group. At the end of the first two weeks after admission, clinical manifestations had completely despeared in 31(91.2%)patients in non-severe group, and 18(85.7%) patients in severe group (p=0.85). Both groups had a satisfied chest CT imaging recovery, which includes 22(64.7%) patients in non-severe group and 12(57.1%) patients in severe group recovered at least 50% of the whole leisions in the first week, and 28(82.4%) and 16(76.2%) recovered at least 75% in the second week, respectively. There were no significant differences in SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance between two group (p=0.92). There were also no significant differences in the levels of SARS-CoV-2-IgM and IgG antibody production between the two groups (p=0.13, 0.62). There were 45 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patients died at the time of this clinical analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Risk-adapted treatment strategy was associated with significant clinical manifestations alleviation and clinical imaging recovery. In severe COVID-19 patients, early and short-term use of low-dose methylprednisolone was beneficial and did not delay SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and influence IgG antibody production.","Int J Infect Dis","Zheng, Changcheng","Wang, Jinquan","Guo, Hui","Lu, Zhaohui","Ma, Yan","Zhu, Yuyou","Xia, Daqing","Wang, Yinzhong","He, Hongliang","Zhou, Jian","Wang, Yong","Fei, Mingming","Yin, Yihong","Zheng, Mao","Xu, Yehong","32229257"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: There are no clear expert consensus or guidelines on how to treat 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
