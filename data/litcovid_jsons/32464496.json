Nevertheless, genetic factors in different ethnic groups often contribute to disease severity and treatment response. In particular, the frequency of genetic variations in the androgen receptor differs by ethnicity and gender. For example, the increased prevalence of prostate cancer and androgenetic alopecia among African Americans correlates with the frequency of these variants.
