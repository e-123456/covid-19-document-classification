The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of the disease. Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected. Most locally-acquired cases are able to be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked. The distribution of overseas-acquired cases to locally acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. Internationally, cases continue to increase. The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained. The epidemiology differs from country to country depending not only on the disease, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures.","Commun Dis Intell (2018)","32299330"],"abstract":["Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 12 April 2020: notifications = 6,394; deaths = 46.
