RESULTS: Elevated neutrophil-to-LYM ratio (NLR), D-dimer(D-D), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-2, interferon-Y, and age were significantly associated with the severity of illness. However, significant and sustained decreases were observed in the LYM subset (p<0.05).

FINDINGS: Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts [0.6 (0.6-0.8)] but increases in neutrophil counts [4.7 (3.6-5.8)] than 27 mild cases [1.1 (0.8-1.4); 2.0 (1.5-2.9)].
