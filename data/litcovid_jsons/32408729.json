OBJECTIVES: To present the results of a systematic scientific literature search performed on papers published from April 1st to April 30th, 2020. METHODS: A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, PEDro, Web of Science and the main international guideline databases for articles published (including Epub), in English, from April 1st to April 30th, 2020. Papers were included if they reported on one of the following: 1) prevalence and features of the emerging disability after Covid-19; 2) rehabilitation strategies applied for Covid-19 patients, regardless of setting or stage; 3) information about rehabilitation services after Covid-19; 4) impact on diseases of rehabilitative interest; 5) complications of rehabilitative interest. RESULTS: Out of 445 articles retrieved for the time frame, 50 were finally included for qualitative analysis. They consist of 7 guidelines, 1 scoping review, 1 randomized controlled trial, 4 descriptive studies (qualitative), 1 case series, 1 case report, and 35 expert opinions. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic rapid living review showed an increasing evidence on rehabilitation needs due to COVID-19 outbreak during April 2020. The main novelties include: 1) the first appearance of epidemiological data on the likely high incidence of neurological complications/disabling sequelae in patients hospitalized for COVID-19; 2) rapid guidelines on the management of chronically disabled patients in the COVID-19 era; 3) advices to provide COVID-19 patients with early respiratory rehabilitation in the acute phase, and with telemonitoring and telerehabilitation in the post-acute phase. Although the overall quality of studies has increased, prospective cohort studies on disability course in COVID-19 pandemic and experimental studies on the effects of rehabilitation are still warranted.","Eur J Phys Rehabil Med","de Sire, Alessandro","Andrenelli, Elisa","Negrini, Francesco","Negrini, Stefano","Ceravolo, Maria Gabriella","32408729"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: This paper adds to the series of systematic rapid living reviews, started in April 2020, to provide the rehabilitation community with updates on the latest scientific literature on rehabilitation needs due to Covid-19 pandemic.

Patients not receiving care due to closure of outpatient services suffer a collateral damage. Our aim was to provide first data on impact of Covid-19 on people experiencing disability in Europe. METHODS: We developed an estimation from a survey and publicly available data. Thirty-eight countries have been inquired through the European Bodies of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine - the rehabilitation medical specialty. The 9-questions focused on March 31st, 2020. We used the following indicators: for inpatients, acute and rehabilitative hospital beds; for outpatients, missing uniform European data, we used information from Italy, Belgium and UK, and estimated for Europe basing on population, number of rehabilitation physicians, physiotherapists, and people with self-reported limitations. FINDINGS: Thirty-five countries (92%) including 99% of the population (809.9 million) answered. Stop of admissions to rehabilitation, early discharge and reduction of activities involved 194,800 inpatients in 10 countries. Outpatient activities stopped for 87%, involving 318,000 patients per day in Italy, Belgium and UK, leading to an estimate range of 1,3-2,2 million in Europe. Seven countries reported experiences on rehabilitation for acute Covid-19 patients. INTERPRETATION: Covid-19 emergency is having a huge impact on rehabilitation of people experiencing disability. This may lead to future cumulative effects due to reduced functional outcome and consequent increased burden of care. When the emergency will fade, rehabilitation demand will probably grow due to an expected return wave of these not well treated patients, but probably also of post-Covid-19 patients' needs.","Eur J Phys Rehabil Med","Negrini, Stefano","Grabljevec, Klemen","Boldrini, Paolo","Kiekens, Carlotte","Moslavac, Sasa","Zampolini, Mauro","Christodoulou, Nicolas","32383576"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic is having a great impact on health services.
