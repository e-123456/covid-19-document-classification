We investigated an association between delay in radical prostatectomy (RP) and oncological outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective review of men with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer (PC) in the National Cancer Database (NCDB) underdoing radical prostatectomy from 2010-2016. Immediate RP was defined as RP within 3-months of diagnosis, while delayed RP was analyzed in 3-month intervals up to 12-months. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to test for associations between levels of delayed RP and outcomes of interest (adverse pathology, upgrading on RP, node positive disease, and post-RP secondary treatments) compared with men undergoing immediate RP. RESULTS: We identified 128,062 men with intermediate- and high-risk PC treated with RP. After adjustment, we did not appreciate a significant difference in odds of adverse pathology, upgrading, node positive disease, or post-RP secondary treatments between men treated with immediate RP and any level of delay up to 12 months. Subgroup analysis of men with Grade group 4 and 5 PC did not demonstrate an association between delayed RP and worse oncological outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In the NCDB, delayed RP was not associated with early adverse oncological outcomes at RP. These results may provide reassurance to patients and urologists balancing care in the current pandemic.","J Urol","Ginsburg, Kevin B","Curtis, Gannon L","Timar, Ryan E","George, Arvin K","Cher, Michael L","32356508"],"abstract":["PURPOSE: The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has forced many healthcare organizations to divert efforts and resources to emergent patient care, delaying many elective oncological surgeries.

Inhibition of TMPRSS2 may work to block or decrease the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Intriguingly, TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated gene that is upregulated in prostate cancer where it supports tumor progression and is involved in a frequent genetic translocation with the ERG gene. First- or second-generation androgen-deprivation therapies (ADTs) decrease the levels of TMPRSS2. Here we put forward the hypothesis that ADTs may protect patients affected by prostate cancer from SARS-CoV-2 infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted data regarding 9280 patients (4532 males) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 68 hospitals in Veneto, one of the Italian regions that was most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The parameters used for each COVID-19 positive patient were gender, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), death, tumor diagnosis, prostate cancer diagnosis, and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). RESULTS: There were 9280 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in the Veneto on April 1, 2020. Overall, males developed more severe complications, were more frequently hospitalized, and had a worse clinical outcome than females. Considering only the Veneto male population (2.4 Million men), 0.2% and 0.3% of non-cancer and cancer patients, respectively, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Comparing the total number of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, prostate cancer patients receiving ADT had a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to patients who did not receive ADT (OR 4.05; 95% CI 1.55-10.59). A greater difference was found comparing prostate cancer patients receiving ADT to patients with any other type of cancer (OR 5.17; 95% CI 2.02-13.40). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that cancer patients have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections than non-cancer patients. However, prostate cancer patients receiving ADT appear to be partially protected from SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Ann Oncol","Montopoli, M","Zumerle, S","Vettor, R","Rugge, M","Zorzi, M","Catapano, C V","Carbone, G M","Cavalli, A","Pagano, F","Ragazzi, E","Prayer-Galetti, T","Alimonti, A","32387456"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to ACE2 and on S protein priming by TMPRSS2.
