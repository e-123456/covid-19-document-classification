The current population-based study aimed to evaluate the depression and anxiety of people in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Multiple logistic regression analysis found that not experiencing the SARS outbreak in 2003, being worried about being infected by COVID-19, being bothered by having not enough surgical masks and being bothered by not being able to work from home were associated with a poorer mental health status.
