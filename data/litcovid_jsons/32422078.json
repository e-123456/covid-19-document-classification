Objective: To investigate the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and other poor obstetrical outcomes. Design: All suspected cases of pregnant women with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted into one center of Wuhan from Jan 20, 2020 to March 19, 2020 were included.

Results: Twenty-seven laboratory or clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection pregnant women (4 early pregnancies included) and 24 neonates born to the 23 late pregnant mothers were analyzed. On admission, 46.2% (13/27) of the patients had symptoms, including fever (11/27), cough (9/27) and vomiting (1/27). Decreased total lymphocytes count was observed in 81.6% (22/27) patients. Twenty-six patients showed typical viral pneumonia by chest computed tomography (CT) scan, while one patient confirmed with COVID-19 infection showed no abnormality on chest CT. One mother developed severe pneumonia three days after her delivery. No maternal and perinatal death occurred.

This analysis reveals that unlike coronavirus infections of pregnant women caused by SARS and MERS, in these 38 pregnant women COVID-19 did not lead to maternal deaths. Importantly, and similar to pregnancies with SARS and MERS, there were no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mothers with COVID-19 to their fetuses. All neonatal specimens tested, including in some cases placentas, were negative by rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.
