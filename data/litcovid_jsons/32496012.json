The objective of this study was to evaluate the influences of diabetes mellitus on the severity and fatality of SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of 66 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were collected and classified into non-severe (mild/moderate cases) and severe (severe/critical cases) groups, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk of severe COVID-19 (severe/critical infection). In addition, a meta-analysis including published studies reported the impacts of diabetes mellitus on severity and fatality of COVID-19, and our current study was conducted using fixed-effects models. RESULTS: There were 22 diabetic and 44 non-diabetic cases among the 66 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. As the results shown, seven cases (31.82%) were diagnosed as severe COVID-19 in diabetic patients, which was significantly higher than that in non-diabetic group (4/44, 9.09%, P = 0.033). After adjustment for age and gender, the results showed that diabetes mellitus was significantly associated with COVID-19 severity (OR: 5.29, 95% CI: 1.07-26.02). A meta-analysis further confirmed the positive association between diabetes mellitus and COVID-19 severity (pooled OR = 2.58, 95% CI: 1.93-3.45). Moreover, the diabetic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed to have 2.95-fold higher risk of fatality compared to those patients without diabetes mellitus (95% CI: 1.93-4.53). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide new evidences that diabetes mellitus is associated with a higher risk of severity and fatality of COVID-19.
