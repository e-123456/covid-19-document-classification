National guidelines currently recommend 12-14 in-person prenatal visits, a schedule unchanged since 1930. In scrutinizing the standard prenatal visit schedule, it quickly becomes clear that prenatal care is overdue for a redesign. We have strong evidence of the benefit of many prenatal services, like screening for gestational diabetes and maternal vaccination. Yet how to deliver these services is much less clear. Studies of prenatal services consistently demonstrate such care can be delivered in fewer than 14 visits, and that we do not need to provide all maternity services in person. Telemedicine has emerged as a promising care delivery option for patients seeking greater flexibility, and early trials leveraging virtual care and remote monitoring have shown positive maternal and fetal outcomes with high patient satisfaction. Our institution has worked for the past year on a new prenatal care pathway. Our initial work assessed the literature, elicited patient perspectives, and captured the insights of experts in patient-centered care delivery. Two key principles emerged to inform prenatal care redesign: 1) design care delivery around essential services, using in-person care for services that cannot be delivered remotely and offering video visits for other essential services; and 2) create flexible services for anticipatory guidance and psychosocial support that allow patients to tailor support to meet their needs through opt-in programs. The rise of COVID-19 prompted us to extend this early work and rapidly implement a redesigned prenatal care pathway. In this paper, we outline our experience rapidly transitioning prenatal care to a new model with 4 in-person visits, 1 ultrasound visit, and 4 virtual visits (the 4-1-4 prenatal plan).

Telemedicine has emerged as an obvious choice to counter these impediments. However, its potential for maintaining outpatient care at pre-pandemic levels during these rapidly changing times is untested. Therefore, we analyzed our experience in a tertiary care epilepsy center. Methods: We divided the study period from March 1, 2020 to April 15, 2020 into a baseline, transition (to telemedicine), and current phase. We divided outpatient encounters into clinic, virtual (using Cleveland Clinic Express Care Online platform), and telephone (including commercial video conferencing platforms). Results: Completed outpatient visits during baseline and current period were 595 and 590, respectively. Nearly 1 out of 4 patients missed outpatient visits during the transition period. The virtual visits accounted for 19.7% of completed visits during baseline and increased to 66.8% during the current period. There were no telephone visits during the baseline phase but accounted for 26.1% of completed visits during the current phase.
