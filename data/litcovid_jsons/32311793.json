BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a major threat to public health. Nurses have always played an important role in infection prevention, infection control, isolation, containment, and public health. However, available data on the work stress among these nurses is limited. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey. An online questionnaire was completed by 180 anti-epidemic nurses from Guangxi. Data collection tools, including the Chinese version of the Stress Overload Scale (SOS) and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Descriptive, single factor, correlation, and multiple regression analyses were used in exploring related influencing factors. RESULTS: The SOS (39.91+/-12.92) and SAS scores (32.19+/-7.56) of this nurse group were positively correlated (r=0.676, p<0.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that only children, working hours per week, and anxiety were the main factors affecting nurse stress (p=0.000, 0.048, 0.000, respectively).
