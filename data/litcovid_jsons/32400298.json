Our online learning programme has three online components, reflecting the domains of educational environment theory: asynchronous discussion forums; a symposium facilitating social interactions and teacher presence, and a portfolio facilitating personal goal aspects. The latter is underpinned by a multi-theories model of adult learning, built upon the scaffolding framework that supports our entire medical curriculum. Within this theory, we propose a five-stage model of learning.
