Median absorption time and length of hospitalization for all patients was 6 days (IQR 5-8) and 17 days (IQR 13-25), respectively. CONCLUSION: Radiological findings and clinical characteristics in pregnant women with COVID-19 were similar to those of non-pregnant women with COVID-19. Median absorption time and length of hospitalization in asymptomatic patients were significantly shorter than in symptomatic patients. Lymphocyte percentage and neutrophil granulocyte rate may be used as laboratory indicators of CT absorption."],"journal":"Int J Gynaecol Obstet","authors":["Wu, Xiaoqing","Sun, Ruihong","Chen, Jianpu","Xie, Yuanliang","Zhang, Shutong","Wang, Xiang"],"date":"2020-04-10T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32270479","source":"PubMed","week":"202015|Apr 06 - Apr 12","doi":"10.1002/ijgo.13165","keywords":["covid-19","ct scan","pneumonia","pregnancy"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138491851898880,"score":244.11215}]}
