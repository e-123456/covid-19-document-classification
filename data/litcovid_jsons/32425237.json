The pandemic has spread rapidly causing widespread devastation globally. Purpose: This review provides a brief understanding of pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis and management of COVID-19 and highlights the current knowledge as well as best practices for orthopaedic surgeons. These are likely to change as knowledge and evidence is gained. Results: Orthopaedic surgeons, like other front-line workers, carry the risk of getting infected during their practice, which as such is already substantially affected. Implementation of infection prevention and control as well as other safety measures for health care workers assumes great importance. All patients/visitors and staff visiting the hospital should be screened. Conservative treatment should be the first line of treatment except for those requiring urgent/emergent care. During lockdown all elective surgeries are to be withheld. All attempts should be made to reduce hospital visits and telemedicine is to be encouraged. Inpatient management of COVID-19 patients requires approval from concerned authorities. All patients being admitted to the hospital in and around containment zones should be tested for COVID-19. There are special considerations for anaesthesia with preference for regional anaesthesia. A separate Operation room with specific workflow should be dedicated for COVID-19 positive cases. Conclusions: Despite the magnitude of challenge, the pandemic offers significant lessons for the orthopaedic surgeon who should seek the opportunity within the adversity and use this time wisely to achieve his/her Ikigai.","Indian J Orthop","Chhabra, Harvinder Singh","Bagaraia, Vaibhav","Keny, Swapnil","Kalidindi, Kalyan Kumar Varma","Mallepally, Abhinandan","Dhillon, Mandeep Singh","Malhotra, Rajesh","Rajasekharan, Shanmuganathan","32425237"],"abstract":["Background: A mysterious cluster outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China in December 2019 was traced to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and declared a Pandemic by WHO on 11th March 2020.

Older individuals are deemed to be at higher risk for poor outcomes with COVID-19. Although previous studies have shown a high proportion of older providers nationwide across medical specialties, we are not aware of any previous study that has analyzed the age distribution among the orthopaedic workforce. Therefore, the purposes of the present study were (1) to determine the geographic distribution of U.S. orthopaedic surgeons by age, (2) to compare the distribution with other surgical specialties, and (3) to compare this distribution with the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: Demographic statistics from the most recent State Physician Workforce Data Reports published by the Association of American Medical Colleges were extracted to identify the 2018 statewide proportion of practicing orthopaedic surgeons >/=60 years of age as well as age-related demographic data for all surgical specialties. Geospatial data on the distribution of COVID-19 cases were obtained from the Environmental Systems Research Institute. State boundary files were taken from the U.S. Census Bureau. Orthopaedic workforce age data were utilized to group states into quintiles. RESULTS: States with the highest quintile of orthopaedic surgeons >/=60 years of age included states most severely affected by COVID-19: New York, New Jersey, California, and Florida. For all states, the median number of providers >/=60 years of age was 105.5 (interquartile range [IQR], 45.5 to 182.5). The median proportion of orthopaedic surgeons >/=60 years of age was higher than that of all other surgical subspecialties, apart from thoracic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, the present report provides the first age-focused view of the orthopaedic workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. States in the highest quintile of orthopaedic surgeons >/=60 years old are also among the most overwhelmed by COVID-19. As important orthopaedic acute care continues in addition to COVID-19 frontline service, special considerations may be needed for at-risk staff.
