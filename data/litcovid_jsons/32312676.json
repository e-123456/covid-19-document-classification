Guidelines of the French Association of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology (AFOP) and French Society of Otorhinolaryngology (SFORL).","OBJECTIVE: joint guidelines of the French Pediatric Otolaryngology Society (AFOP) and of the French Society of otorhinolaryngology - Head and neck Surgery (SFORL) on the management of paediatric otolaryngology patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A nation-wide workgroup drew guidelines based on clinical experience, national and local recommendations and scientific literature. Proposals may have to be updated on a day-to-day basis. RESULTS: In children, incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 (1-5%) is low and of good prognosis. The indications for nasal flexible endoscopy should be drastically limited. If undertaken, full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including FFP2 masks are required, as well as use of a sheath. Saline nose wash done by caregivers other than parents at home should require PPE. Unless foreign body tracheobronchial aspiration is clinically obvious, CT-scan should be performed to confirm indication of endoscopy. Surgical indications should be limited to emergencies and to cases that cannot be delayed beyond 2 months (especially endonasal, endopharyngeal laryngo-tracheobronchial procedures). Postponement should ideally be a group decision and recorded as such in the medical file. Surgical techniques should be adapted to limit the risk of viral dissemination in the air, avoiding the use of drills, microdebriders, monopolar cautery or lasers. Continuous suction should be placed near the operating field. In case of confirmed Covid-19 cases, or suspected cases (or in some centres systematically), PPE with FFP2 mask should be worn by all staff members present in the operating room.","Eur Ann Otorhinolaryngol Head Neck Dis","Leboulanger, N","Sagardoy, T","Akkari, M","Ayari-Khalfallah, S","Celerier, C","Fayoux, P","Luscan, R","Mansbach, A L","Moreddu, E","Pondaven, S","Simon, F","Teissier, N","Thierry, B","Fanoux, A","Lescanne, E","Nicollas, R","Couloigner, V","32312676"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: joint guidelines of the French Pediatric Otolaryngology Society (AFOP) and of the French Society of otorhinolaryngology - Head and neck Surgery (SFORL) on the management of paediatric otolaryngology patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Appropriate use of PPE is essential to minimize transmission and preserve supply. Pediatric endoscopic procedures are considered at high risk for COVID-19 transmission.
