Literature and Neurosurgical Societies Recommendations Update.","BACKGROUND: Since January 2020, 3 months ago, when the pathogen causing the Coronavirus-disease was identified in humans, the literature on COVID-19 has grown exponentially to over 4000 publications. There is the need to provide an update for each single medical discipline, including neurosurgery, to be used by single professionals or to be distributed through the neurosurgical community and to be used by governments in designing new scenario of care. METHODS: A review of the MEDLINE database was performed on April 13th, 2020. Search terms included \"COVID-19\", \"neurosurgery,\" and \"surgery\". A review of documents published on the web-page of the WFNS and of the 5 continental associations of neurosurgical societies AANS, AASNS, CAANS, EANS, and FLANC representing the 119 national Neurosurgical Societies around the world was performed. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 38 results that were manually reviewed. Fourteen manuscripts were considered eligible. They described suggestions and considerations to optimize care of neurosurgical patients, editorials on operational models, perspectives from neurosurgical departments, letters to the editor describing experiences on how to help medical staff to be prepared in advance for pandemic situations, description of regional or departmental models and/or organizational schemes. The webpages of the searched societies reported a total of 57 documents. CONCLUSIONS: The neurosurgical scientific community has promptly reacted to the COVID-19 outbreak by producing a growing number of documents that could serve as guidance for neurosurgeons all over the world. Neurosurgical Societies will represent the key-institutions for guiding the neurosurgical community to overcome the COVID-19 crisis.","World Neurosurg","Germano, Antonino","Raffa, Giovanni","Angileri, Filippo Flavio","Cardali, Salvatore Massimiliano","Tomasello, Francesco","32360733"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Since January 2020, 3 months ago, when the pathogen causing the Coronavirus-disease was identified in humans, the literature on COVID-19 has grown exponentially to over 4000 publications.

METHODS: We performed an internet-based survey among Presidents and Members of the Societies of the Latin American Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (FLANC). We blindly analyzed information about local conditions and their impact on neurosurgical praxis using SPSS(R) software. RESULTS: Information came from 21 countries. Sixteen Society Presidents reported having suspended regular activities, and differing local scheduled congresses, fourteen reported mandatory isolation by government, and four instituted a telemedicine project. Four-hundred eighty-six colleagues, mean age 49 years, reported a mean 79% reduction in their neurosurgical praxis. Seventy-six percent of neurosurgeons had savings to self-support for 3-6 months, if restrictions are long lasting. CONCLUSIONS: Stopping activities among Societies of the FLANC, together with a drop of 79% of neurosurgical praxis, adds to deficits in provider s protection equipment and increasing demand for attention in the healthcare systems; representing a huge financial risk for their sustainability. Neurosurgeons should involve in local policies to protect health and economy.

At the time we write this article, our country is facing a community spread phase, expecting a rapid increase in the number of cases and fatalities. The Fray Antonio Alcalde Civil Hospital of Guadalajara has been declared a non-COVID-19 hospital with the mission of providing care to patients already registered and also those transferred from neurosurgical departments of neighboring centers, which have been converted into COVID-19 only hospitals. METHODS: An organized response regarding personnel, surgical case selection, operating room behavior, and facility reorganization were designed to prevent an internal coronavirus outbreak in the neurosurgery department at the Fray Antonio Alcalde Civil Hospital of Guadalajara. RESULTS: Distancing actions by the staff and residents, including ward case discussions, neurosurgery rounds, and classes, will be carried out virtually. We classified neurosurgical patients into 4 groups depending on whether their condition demands care in 0-6 hours, 6-48 hours, 48 hours to 14 days, and >14 days. Subsequently, a questionnaire with epidemiologic, radiologic, clinical, and serologic criteria will be applied to determine the risk of COVID-19 infection to define to which area they are going to be transferred according to the different risk zones in our facility. CONCLUSIONS: Despite not being a COVID-19 center, we consider all patients at the neurosurgical ward and staff members as asymptomatic carriers or infected in the preclinical period.
