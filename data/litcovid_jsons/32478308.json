Here, we reveal sequences of the virus isolated from three different patients with various clinical presentations. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab specimens of the patients were tested positive for the COVID-19 by qRT-PCR. Viral RNA extraction was performed from the same swab samples. Amplicon based libraries were prepared and sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq platform. Raw sequencing data were processed for variant calling and generating near-complete genome sequences. All three genomes were evaluated and compared with other worldwide isolates. RESULTS: The patients showed various clinics (an asymptomatic patient, patient with mild disease, and with severe pulmonary infiltration). Amplicon-based next-generation sequencing approach successfully applied to generate near-complete genomes with an average depth of 2.616. All three viral genomes carried the D614G variant (G clade according to GISAID classification) with implications for the origin of a spread first through China to Europe then to Istanbul. CONCLUSION: Here, we report the viral genomes circulating in Istanbul for the first time. Further sequencing of the virus isolates may enable us to understand variations in disease presentation and association with viral factors if there is any. In addition, the sequencing of more viral genomes will delineate the spread of disease and will guide and ease the necessary measures taken to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.","North Clin Istanb","Karacan, Ilker","Akgun, Tugba Kizilboga","Agaoglu, N Bugra","Irvem, Arzu","Alkurt, Gizem","Yildiz, Jale","Kose, Betsi","Ozel, A Serra","Altunal, L Nilsun","Can, Nisan Denizce","Demirkol, Yasemin Kendir","Aydin, Mehtap","Dogan, Ozlem Akgun","Doganay, Levent","Doganay, Gizem Dinler","32478289"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: Turkey is one of the latest countries that COVID-19 disease was reported, with the first case on March 11, 2020, and since then, Istanbul became the epicenter of the pandemic in Turkey.
