The team formulated various measures, such as reconfiguration of the radiology department, personal protection and staff training, standardized imaging examination procedures for fever patients and common patients, and so on. RESULTS: From January 21 to March 9, 3,083 people underwent fever-CT examinations. Including the initial examination and reexamination, the total number of fever CT examination is 3,340. As a result of our precautions, none of the staff of the radiology department was infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Strategic planning and adequate protections can help protect patients and staff against a highly infectious disease while allow normal functioning at a high-volume capacity.","J Am Coll Radiol","Huang, Zixing","Zhao, Shuang","Li, Zhenlin","Chen, Weixia","Zhao, Lihong","Deng, Lipeng","Song, Bin","32208140"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To describe the strategy and the emergency management and infection control procedures of our radiology department during the COVID-19 outbreak.
