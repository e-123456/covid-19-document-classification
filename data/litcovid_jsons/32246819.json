MATERIAL AND METHODS From 20 January 2020 to 2 February 2020, 6 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including 1 male and 5 females, were retrospectively reviewed in Zhejiang Hospital. These cases were clinically assessed and classified as common COVID-19. All patients underwent thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) within 2 days after the onset of symptoms, and their images were viewed by 2 radiologists who were blind to their clinical records.

Two cases (33.3%) had a single lesion, 2 cases (33.3%) had 2 lesions, and 2 cases (33.3%) had multiple lesions.
