To date, only a few studies have reported the distribution of lung lesions by segment. This study aimed to evaluate the lobar and segmental distribution of COVID-19 pneumonia based on patients' chest CT scan. Methods: This was a retrospective study performed on 63 Iranian adult patients with a final diagnosis of COVID-19. All patients had undergone chest CT scan on admission. Demographic data and imaging profile, including segmental distribution, were evaluated. Moreover, a scoring scale was designed to assess the severity of ground-glass opacification (GGO).

Results: Among included patients, mean age of patients was 54.2 +/-14.9 (range: 26 - 81) years old and 60.3% were male. Overall, the right lower lobe (87.3%) and the left lower lobe (85.7%) were more frequently involved.

Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and lymphadenopathy were uncommon findings. In addition, baseline chest CT did not show any abnormalities in 21 patients (23%), but 3 patients presented bilateral ground glass opacities on the second CT after 3-4 days. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be confirmed based on the patient's history, clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, and laboratory tests. Chest CT examination plays an important role in the initial diagnosis of the novel coronavirus pneumonia. Multiple patchy ground glass opacities in bilateral multiple lobular with periphery distribution are typical chest CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia."],"journal":"Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging","authors":["Xu, Xi","Yu, Chengcheng","Qu, Jing","Zhang, Lieguang","Jiang, Songfeng","Huang, Deyang","Chen, Bihua","Zhang, Zhiping","Guan, Wanhua","Ling, Zhoukun","Jiang, Rui","Hu, Tianli","Ding, Yan","Lin, Lin","Gan, Qingxin","Luo, Liangping","Tang, Xiaoping","Liu, Jinxin"],"date":"2020-02-29T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32107577","source":"PubMed","week":"20209|Feb 24 - Mar 01","doi":"10.1007/s00259-020-04735-9","keywords":["2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia","covid-19","computed tomography","ground glass opacification","imaging features","infection","sars-cov-2"],"locations":["Wuhan","China","China","Guangzhou","China","Wuhan"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Mechanism","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138490776059906,"score":252.4663}]}
