Our study investigated the demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging features of 63 patients with COVID-19 in Beijing. Patients were classified into four groups, mild, moderate, severe and critically ill. The mean age of our patients was 47 years of age (range 3-85) and there was a slight male predominance (58.7%). Thirty percent of our patients had severe or critically ill disease, but only 20% of severe and 33% of critically ill patients had been to Wuhan. Fever was the most common presentation (84.1%), but cough was present in only slightly over half of the patients. We found that lymphocyte and eosinophils count were significantly decreased in patients with severe disease (p = 0.001 and p = 0.000, respectively). Eosinopenia was a feature of higher levels of severity. Peripheral CD4(+), CD8(+) T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes were significantly decreased in severe and critically ill patients, but there was only a non-statistically significant downward trend in NK cell numbers with severity. Of note is that liver function tests including AST, ALT, GGT and LDH were elevated, and albumin was decreased. The inflammatory markers CRP, ESR and ferritin were elevated in patients with severe disease or worse. IL-6 levels were also higher, indicating that the presence of a hyperimmune inflammatory state portends higher morbidity and mortality.

Demographic, clinical, laboratory information, especially T lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines were reported. For patients who died or discharge from hospital, the associations of T lymphocyte subsets on admission were evaluated by univariate logistic regression with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), warning values to predict in-hospital death were assessed by Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves.
