The majority of fellows felt prepared to practice ablative (96%), and microvascular surgery (73%), and 57% have secured employment to follow graduation.

CASE REPORT: Clinical and radiographic data were obtained from the electronic medical record. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained and evaluated for COVID-19 by the Food and Drug Administration-approved reverse transcription-PCR assays. On radiographic examination, PET/CT was consistent with COVID-19-related pneumonia not seen on prior imaging. Initial nasopharyngeal swab 2 days after PET/CT imaging was negative for COVID-19. Subsequent repeat swab 10 days later was positive for COVID-19, while the patient was febrile on screening assessment. The patient remained COVID-19-positive until 1 month after abnormal PET/CT imaging. CONCLUSION: PET/CT can be sensitive for early COVID-19 detection, even in the setting of a negative confirmatory PCR test.
