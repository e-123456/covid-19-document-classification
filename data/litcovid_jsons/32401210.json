Social media, especially, Sina Weibo (a major Chinese microblogging social media platform), has become an important platform for the public to obtain information and express their demand. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the characteristics of the suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients who asked for help on the Sina Weibo. METHODS: We conducted data mining on the Chinese social media site Sina Weibo and extracted the data of 485 patients that presented with at least clinical symptoms and imaging descriptions of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia from 9,878 posts seeking help on Weibo from February 3rd to 20th, 2020.We used descriptive research method to describe the distribution and other epidemiological characteristics of the patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The distance from their home to the nearest hospital was calculated using geographic information systems (ArcGIS). RESULTS: All patients seeking help on Weibo in this study lived in Wuhan, with a median age of 63.0 years (IQR, 55.0-71.0). Fever (84.12%, 408/485) was the most common symptom. Ground-glass opacity (75.48%, 237/314) was the most common pattern on chest computed tomography.39.67% (167/421) of families had laboratory-confirmed and/or suspected COVID-19 family members. 36.58% (154/421) of families had 1 or 2 laboratory-confirmed and/or suspected family members.70.52% (232/329) of patients needed to rely on their descendants for help. The median time from illness onset to real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) testing was 8 days (IQR, 5.0-10.0), and the median time from illness onset to online help was 10 days (IQR, 6.0-12.0). 32.22% (155/481) of patients lived more than 3 kilometers away from the nearest hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The patients seeking help on Weibo lived in Wuhan and most of the patients were elderly. Most of patients had fever symptoms and chest computed tomography mainly manifested as ground-glass opacity pattern. The onset of the disease was characterized by family clustering and most of families lived far from the hospital. Therefore, (1) We recommend that the most stringent centralized medical observation measures should be taken to avoid transmission of family cluster; (2) Social media can help these patients get early attention during the closure of Wuhan. These findings can help the government and the health department identify high-risk patients and accelerate emergency responses following public help demands.

Infoveillance approaches using social media can help characterize disease distribution and public knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors critical to the early stages of an outbreak. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to conduct a quantitative and qualitative assessment of Chinese social media posts originating in Wuhan City on the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Chinese-language messages from Wuhan were collected for 39 days between December 23, 2019, and January 30, 2020, on Weibo. For quantitative analysis, the total daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan were obtained from the Chinese National Health Commission, and a linear regression model was used to determine if Weibo COVID-19 posts were predictive of the number of cases reported. Qualitative content analysis and an inductive manual coding approach were used to identify parent classifications of news and user-generated COVID-19 topics. RESULTS: A total of 115,299 Weibo posts were collected during the study time frame consisting of an average of 2956 posts per day (minimum 0, maximum 13,587). Quantitative analysis found a positive correlation between the number of Weibo posts and the number of reported cases from Wuhan, with approximately 10 more COVID-19 cases per 40 social media posts (P<.001). This effect size was also larger than what was observed for the rest of China excluding Hubei Province (where Wuhan is the capital city) and held when comparing the number of Weibo posts to the incidence proportion of cases in Hubei Province. Qualitative analysis of 11,893 posts during the first 21 days of the study period with COVID-19-related posts uncovered four parent classifications including Weibo discussions about the causative agent of the disease, changing epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak, public reaction to outbreak control and response measures, and other topics. Generally, these themes also exhibited public uncertainty and changing knowledge and attitudes about COVID-19, including posts exhibiting both protective and higher-risk behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide initial insight into the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of Chinese social media data at the initial epicenter in Wuhan City.

First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages.
