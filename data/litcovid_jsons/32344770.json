China has experienced the unprecedented epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in an era when social media has fundamentally transformed information production and consumption patterns. OBJECTIVE: This study examined public engagement and government responsiveness in the communications about COVID-19 during the early epidemic stage based on analysis of data from Sina Weibo, a major social media platform in China. METHODS: Weibo data relevant to COVID-19 from December 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020 were retrieved. Engagement data (Likes, Comments, Shares and Followers) of posts from government agency accounts were extracted to evaluate public engagement with government posts online. Content analyses were conducted for a random subset of 644 posts from personal accounts of individuals, and 273 posts from 10 relatively more active government agency accounts and the National Health Commission of China to identify major thematic contents in online discussions. Latent class analysis (LCA) was employed to further explore main content patterns while Chi-square for trend examined how proportions of main content patterns changed by time within the study timeframe. RESULTS: Public response to COVID-19 seemed to follow the spread of the disease and government actions but was earlier on Weibo than the government. Online users generally had low engagement with posts relevant COVID-19 from government agency accounts. The common content patterns identified in personal and government posts included sharing epidemic situation, general knowledge of the new disease, and policies, guidelines and official actions. However, personal posts more likely showed empathy to affected people (chi-square=13.3, P<.001), attributed blame to other individuals or government (chi-square=28.9, P<.001), and expressed worry about the epidemic (chi-square=32.1, P<.001) while government posts more likely shared instrumental support (chi-square=32.5, P<.001) and praised people or organizations (chi-square=8.7, P=.003). As the epidemic evolved, sharing situation update (chi-square for trend=19.7, P<.001), and policies, guidelines and official actions (chi-square for trend=15.3, P<.001) became less frequent in personal posts but remained stable or increased significantly in government posts.

Therefore, measuring and analyzing online health communication and public sentiment is essential for establishing effective and efficient disease control policies, especially in the early stage of the outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the trends of online health communication, analyze the focus of people's anxiety in the early stages of COVID-19, and evaluate the appropriateness of online information. METHODS: From NAVER, the most popular Korean web portal, 13,148 questions and 29,040 answers related to COVID-19 from 01/20/2020 to 03/02/2020 were collected. Three main methods were used in this study: 1) the structural topic model was used to examine the topics in the online questions, 2) word network analysis was conducted to analyze the focus of people's anxiety and worry in the questions, and 3) two medical doctors assessed the appropriateness of the answers to the questions, which were primarily related to people's anxiety. RESULTS: Fifty topics and six cohesive topic communities were identified from the questions. Among them, topic community No. 4 (suspecting COVID-19 infection after developing a particular symptom) accounted for the largest portion of the questions. As the number of confirmed patients increased, the proportion of topics belonging to topic community No. 4 also increased. Additionally, the prolonged situation led to a slight increase in the proportion of topics related to job issues. People's anxieties and worries were closely related with physical symptoms and self-protection methods. While relatively appropriate to suspect physical symptoms, a high proportion of answers related to self-protection methods were assessed as misinformation or advertisements. CONCLUSIONS: Search activity for online information regarding the COVID-19 outbreak has been active. Many of the online questions were related to people's anxieties and worries. A considerable portion of corresponding answers had false information or were advertisements. The study results could contribute reference information to various countries that need to monitor public anxiety and provide appropriate information in the early stage of an infectious disease outbreak, including COVID-19.
