OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to investigate the pathological alterations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and total cholesterol (TC) in COVID-19 patients and their relationships with the disease severity. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed to examine serum levels of LDL-c, HDL-c, and TC on 597 COVID-19 patients (mild: 394; severe, 171; critical: 32) who were hospitalized in our center between February 1 and March 3, 2020. Age- and gender-matched normal subjects (n = 50) who had routine laboratory lipid tests between October 1 and November 1, 2019 in our center were included as the control group. RESULTS: LDL-c and TC levels were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients as compared with normal subjects (P < .001). There were significant and gradual decreases in levels of LDL-c (median (IQR) in mg/dL, mild: 91 (76, 104); severe: 86 (69, 102); critical: 69 (48, 81); P < .02) and TC (mild: 173 (148, 203); severe: 167 (138, 197); critical: 125 (95, 162); P < .05) across all three groups. HDL-c levels only decreased significantly in critical cases as compared with levels in mild and severe cases. LDL-c and TC levels inversely correlated with C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, and positively correlated with the number of lymphocytes in patients. CONCLUSIONS: Development of hypolipidemia begins in patients with mild symptoms. It progressively becomes worse in an association with the disease severity.","J Clin Lipidol","Wei, Xiuqi","Zeng, Wenjuan","Su, Jingyu","Wan, Huimin","Yu, Xinqin","Cao, Xiaoling","Tan, Wenbin","Wang, Hui","32430154"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Many patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) suffer multiple organ dysfunctions.
