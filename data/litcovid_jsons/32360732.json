There is the need to provide an update for each single medical discipline, including neurosurgery, to be used by single professionals or to be distributed through the neurosurgical community and to be used by governments in designing new scenario of care. METHODS: A review of the MEDLINE database was performed on April 13th, 2020. Search terms included \"COVID-19\", \"neurosurgery,\" and \"surgery\". A review of documents published on the web-page of the WFNS and of the 5 continental associations of neurosurgical societies AANS, AASNS, CAANS, EANS, and FLANC representing the 119 national Neurosurgical Societies around the world was performed. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 38 results that were manually reviewed. Fourteen manuscripts were considered eligible. They described suggestions and considerations to optimize care of neurosurgical patients, editorials on operational models, perspectives from neurosurgical departments, letters to the editor describing experiences on how to help medical staff to be prepared in advance for pandemic situations, description of regional or departmental models and/or organizational schemes. The webpages of the searched societies reported a total of 57 documents. CONCLUSIONS: The neurosurgical scientific community has promptly reacted to the COVID-19 outbreak by producing a growing number of documents that could serve as guidance for neurosurgeons all over the world.

The Fray Antonio Alcalde Civil Hospital of Guadalajara has been declared a non-COVID-19 hospital with the mission of providing care to patients already registered and also those transferred from neurosurgical departments of neighboring centers, which have been converted into COVID-19 only hospitals. METHODS: An organized response regarding personnel, surgical case selection, operating room behavior, and facility reorganization were designed to prevent an internal coronavirus outbreak in the neurosurgery department at the Fray Antonio Alcalde Civil Hospital of Guadalajara. RESULTS: Distancing actions by the staff and residents, including ward case discussions, neurosurgery rounds, and classes, will be carried out virtually. We classified neurosurgical patients into 4 groups depending on whether their condition demands care in 0-6 hours, 6-48 hours, 48 hours to 14 days, and >14 days. Subsequently, a questionnaire with epidemiologic, radiologic, clinical, and serologic criteria will be applied to determine the risk of COVID-19 infection to define to which area they are going to be transferred according to the different risk zones in our facility.
