METHODS: We studied consecutive symptomatic patients with laboratory-proven COVID-19 admitted to a university hospital in Milan, Italy (13.02.2020-10.04.2020). The primary outcome was any thromboembolic complication, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), ischemic stroke, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS)/myocardial infarction (MI).

In the competing risk model, chronic anticoagulation therapy at admission was associated with a lower risk of the composite outcome (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.29, 95%CI 0.091-0.92). Patients diagnosed with thrombotic complications were at higher risk of all-cause death (HR 5.4; 95%CI 2.4-12). Use of therapeutic anticoagulation was not associated with all-cause death (HR 0.79, 95%CI 0.35-1.8). CONCLUSION: In this updated analysis, we confirm the very high cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia."],"journal":"Thromb Res","authors":["Klok, F A","Kruip, M J H A","van der Meer, N J M","Arbous, M S","Gommers, D","Kant, K M","Kaptein, F H J","van Paassen, J","Stals, M A M","Huisman, M V","Endeman, H"],"date":"2020-05-09T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32381264","source":"PubMed","week":"202019|May 04 - May 10","doi":"10.1016/j.thromres.2020.04.041","keywords":["covid-19","deep vein thrombosis","pulmonary embolism","stroke","venous thromboembolism"],"locations":["Dutch","Dutch","Dutch"],"countries":["Netherlands"],"countries_codes":["NLD|Netherlands"],"topics":["Treatment","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666419683380690945,"score":317.5517}]}
