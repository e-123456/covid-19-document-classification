OBJECTIVE: To investigate the onset of hand eczema during the COVID-19 pandemic in health care workers (HCWs) directly involved in intensive care of COVID-19 patients and HCWs without direct contact. Hereby, we aim at increasing awareness with regard to occupational hand eczema and preventive measures that can be undertaken. METHODS: A survey was distributed amongst 114 HCWs at a single surgical site and at a COVID-19 intensive care unit of the university hospital LMU Munich, Germany. Participants were questioned with regard to the daily frequency of hand hygiene prior to and during the pandemic. Participants self-reported onset of hand eczema and associated symptoms. RESULTS: Our study revealed a significant increase of hand washing, disinfection and use of hand cream across all participants (P-value<.001), regardless of having direct contact with COVID-19 patients. A high prevalence of symptoms associated with acute hand dermatitis was found in 90.4% across all HCWs, whereas hand eczema itself was underreported (14.9%). CONCLUSION: The increase of hand sanitation during the COVID-19 pandemic impairs the skin of the hands across all HCWs, independent of direct intensive care of affected patients.
