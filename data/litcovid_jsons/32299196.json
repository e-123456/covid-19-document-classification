MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created a patient portal-based COVID-19 self-triage and self-scheduling tool and made it available to all primary care patients at this large academic health system. Asymptomatic patients were asked about exposure history and were then provided relevant information. Symptomatic patients were triaged into one of four categories-emergent, urgent, non-urgent or self-care- and then connected with the appropriate level of care via direct scheduling or telephone hotline. RESULTS: This self-triage and self-scheduling tool was designed and implemented in under two weeks. During the first 16 days of use, it was completed 1129 times by 950 unique patients. Of completed sessions, 315 (28%) were by asymptomatic patients, and 814 (72%) were by symptomatic patients. Symptomatic patient triage dispositions were as follows: 193 emergent (24%), 193 urgent (24%), 99 nonurgent (12%), 329 self-care (40%). Sensitivity for detecting emergency-level care was 87.5% (95% CI 61.7-98.5%). DISCUSSION: This self-triage and self-scheduling tool has been widely used by patients and is being rapidly expanded to other populations and health systems. The tool has recommended emergency-level care with high sensitivity, and decreased triage time for patients with less severe illness. The data suggests it also prevents unnecessary triage messages, phone calls and in-person visits.

We evaluated the extent to which self-isolation of mildly ill people delays the peak of outbreaks and reduces the need for this care in each Canadian province. METHODS: We developed a computational model and simulated scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks within each province. Using estimates of COVID-19 characteristics, we projected the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed requirements without self-isolation, assuming an average number of 2.5 secondary cases, and compared scenarios in which different proportions of mildly ill people practised self-isolation 24 hours after symptom onset. RESULTS: Without self-isolation, the peak of outbreaks would occur in the first half of June, and an average of 569 ICU bed days per 10 000 population would be needed. When 20% of cases practised self-isolation, the peak was delayed by 2-4 weeks, and ICU bed requirement was reduced by 23.5% compared with no self-isolation. Increasing self-isolation to 40% reduced ICU use by 53.6% and delayed the peak of infection by an additional 2-4 weeks. Assuming current ICU bed occupancy rates above 80% and self-isolation of 40%, demand would still exceed available (unoccupied) ICU bed capacity. INTERPRETATION: At the peak of COVID-19 outbreaks, the need for ICU beds will exceed the total number of ICU beds even with self-isolation at 40%.
