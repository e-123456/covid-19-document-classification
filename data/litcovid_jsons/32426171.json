MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated glycemic control of individuals with T1DM using HCL system in the period before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy (February 10th - 23rd, 2020 - Time 1), when movements were only reduced (February 24th - March 8th, 2020 - Time 2) and during complete lockdown (March 9th-22nd, 2020 - Time 3).
