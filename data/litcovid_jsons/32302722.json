We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. METHODS: All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. FINDINGS: By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49.0 years (IQR 41.0-58.0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8.0 days [IQR 5.0-13.0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.

Compared with young patients, older patients had more laboratory abnormalities and comorbidities. Through a multivariate analysis of the causes of death in older patients, we found that males, comorbidities, time from disease onset to hospitalization, abnormal kidney function, and elevated procalcitonin levels were all significantly associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: In the recent outbreak of COVID-19, our local hospital in Wuhan found that patients aged 65 and older had greater initial comorbidities, more severe symptoms, and were more likely to experience multi-organ involvement and death, as compared with younger patients."],"journal":"J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","authors":["Chen, TieLong","Dai, Zhe","Mo, Pingzheng","Li, Xinyu","Ma, Zhiyong","Song, Shihui","Chen, Xiaoping","Luo, Mingqi","Liang, Ke","Gao, Shicheng","Zhang, Yongxi","Deng, Liping","Xiong, Yong"],"date":"2020-04-13T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32279081","week":"202016|Apr 13 - Apr 19","doi":"10.1093/gerona/glaa089","keywords":["COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2","Wuhan","clinical characteristics","coronavirus","older patients"],"source":"PubMed","topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"locations":["Wuhan","China","Wuhan","Wuhan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"_version_":1663890921972826112,"score":231.3902}]}
