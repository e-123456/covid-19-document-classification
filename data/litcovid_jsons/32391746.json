During an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 with community transmission, our institution utilized an integrated strategy for early detection and containment of COVID-19 amongst healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: Our institution utilized a strategy comprising three key components: enforcing reporting of HCWs with acute respiratory illness (ARI) to our institution's Staff Clinic for monitoring; conducting ongoing syndromic surveillance to obtain early warning of potential clusters of COVID-19, and outbreak investigation and management. RESULTS: Over a 16-week surveillance period, our institution detected 14 cases of COVID-19 amongst HCWs with ARI symptoms. 2 of the cases were linked epidemiologically and thus constituted a COVID-19 cluster with HCW-HCW transmission occurring intra-hospital; we also detected one family cluster and two clusters amongst HCWs who shared accommodation. Through early intervention, our institution contained all detected cases of COVID-19, with no onward transmission to HCWs or patients after containment measures were instituted. Early detection minimized the number of HCWs requiring quarantine, hence preserving business continuity during an ongoing pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: An integrated strategy of surveillance, outbreak management and encouraging individual responsibility was successful in detecting clusters of COVID-19 infection amongst HCWs early. With ongoing local transmission, vigilance must be maintained for intra-hospital spread in non-clinical areas, where social mingling of HCWs occurs. As most individuals with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, addressing presenteeism is crucial to minimize potentially exposed staff and patients.","Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol","Wee, Liang En","Sim, Jean Xiang Ying","Conceicao, Edwin Philip","Aung, May Kyawt","Goh, Jia Qing","Yeo, Dennis Wu Ting","Gan, Wee Hoe","Chua, Ying Ying","Wijaya, Limin","Tan, Thuan Tong","Tan, Ban Hock","Ling, Moi Lin","Venkatachalam, Indumathi","32391746"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: Staff surveillance is crucial during the containment phase of a pandemic, to help reduce potential healthcare-associated transmission as well as sustaining good staff morale.

This poses a challenge for early detection during triage at the emergency department (ED). Over a 3-month period, our ED aimed to minimise nosocomial transmission by using broader suspect case criteria for better detection and using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers (HCWs) METHODS: All ED admissions with respiratory syndromes over a 3-month period were tested for COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of screening criteria in detecting COVID-19 was assessed. A risk-stratified approach was adopted for PPE usage in the ED, based on high-risk \"fever areas\" and lower-risk zones. When a case of COVID-19 was confirmed, surveillance was conducted for potentially exposed patients and HCWs. RESULTS: A total of 1,841 cases presenting with respiratory syndromes required admission over the study period. Amongst these, 70 cases of COVID-19 were subsequently confirmed. The majority (84.2%, 59/70) were picked up at ED triage as they fulfilled suspect case criteria. Of these, 34 met the official screening criteria; another 25 were picked up by the broader internal screening criteria. Over the 12-week period, the cumulative sensitivity of internal screening criteria was 84.3% (95% confidence interval, CI=73.6%-91.9%), whereas the sensitivity of the official screening criteria was 48.6% (95%CI=36.4%- 60.8%). Given the broadened internal criteria, the pre-existing ED \"fever area\" was insufficient and had to be expanded. However, there were no cases of nosocomial transmission from intra-ED exposure, despite extensive surveillance. CONCLUSION: Frontline physicians need to be given leeway to decide on the disposition of cases based on clinical suspicion during an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19. If a broader criterion is used at ED triage, ED facilities and isolation facilities need to be readied to accommodate a surge of suspect cases. Usage of appropriate PPE is essential in minimising nosocomial transmission.","Acad Emerg Med","Wee, Liang En","Fua, Tzay-Ping","Chua, Ying Ying","Ho, Fu Wah Andrew","Sim, Xiang Ying Jean","Conceicao, Edwin Philip","Venkatachalam, Indumathi","Tan, Kenneth Boon-Kiat","Tan, Ban Hock","32281231"],"abstract":["AIMS: Patients with COVID-19 may present with respiratory syndromes indistinguishable from common viruses.
