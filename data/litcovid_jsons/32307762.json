For researchers on intellectual disability such as ourselves, it is of key interest to learn whether this open research dataset may be used to investigate the virus and its consequences for people with an intellectual disability. METHODS: From CORD-19 we identified full text articles containing terms related to the intellectual disability-care and applied a text mining technique, specifically the TF-IDF analysis in combination with K-means clustering. RESULTS: 259 articles contained one or more of our specified terms related to intellectual disability. We were able to cluster these articles related to intellectual disabilities into five clusters on different topics, namely: Mental health, Viral diseases, Diagnoses & Treatments, Maternal care & Pediatrics, and Genetics. CONCLUSION: The CORD-19 open research dataset consists of valuable information about not only COVID-19 disease but also intellectual disabilities and the relationship between them. We suggest researchers investigate Literature-Based Discovery approaches on the CORD-19 and develop a new dataset that addresses the intersection of these two fields for further research.","J Intellect Disabil Res","Tummers, J","Catal, C","Tobi, H","Tekinerdogan, B","Leusink, G","32307762"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been announced as a new coronavirus disease by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Identified in late 2019, COVID-19 quickly became characterized as a global pandemic by March of 2020. Given the rapid acceleration of transmission, and the lack of preparedness to prevent and treat this virus, the negative impacts of COVID-19 are rippling through every facet of society. Although large numbers of people throughout the world will show resilience to the profound loss, stress, and fear associated with COVID-19, the virus will likely exacerbate existing mental health disorders and contribute to the onset of new stress-related disorders for many. RECOMMENDATIONS: The field of traumatic stress should address the serious needs that will emerge now and well into the future. However, we propose that these efforts may be limited, in part, by ongoing gaps that exist within our research and clinical care. In particular, we suggest that COVID-19 requires us to prioritize and mobilize as a research and clinical community around several key areas: (a) diagnostics, (b) prevention, (c) public outreach and communication, (d) working with medical staff and mainstreaming into nonmental health services, and (e) COVID-19-specific trauma research. As members of our community begin to rapidly develop and test interventions for COVID-19-related distress, we hope that those in positions of leadership in the field of traumatic stress consider limits of our current approaches, and invest the intellectual and financial resources urgently needed in order to innovate, forge partnerships, and develop the technologies to support those in greatest need.
