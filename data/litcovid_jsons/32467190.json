METHODS: Patient data were obtained from medical records from the University Hospital \"Principe de Asturias\", Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain and from the University Hospital \"12 de Octubre\", Madrid, Spain. RESULTS: The first patient was a 50-year-old man who presented with anosmia, ageusia, right internuclear ophthalmoparesis, right fascicular oculomotor palsy, ataxia, areflexia, albuminocytologic dissociation and positive testing for GD1b-IgG antibodies. Five days before, he had developed a cough, malaise, headache, low back pain, and a fever. The second patient was a 39-year-old man who presented with ageusia, bilateral abducens palsy, areflexia and albuminocytologic dissociation. Three days before, he had developed diarrhea, a low-grade fever, and a poor general condition. The oropharyngeal swab test for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by qualitative real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay was positive in both patients and negative in the cerebrospinal fluid.

CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 54-years-old Caucasian female patient with typical clinical and electrophysiological manifestations of AIDP, who was reported positive with PCR for SARS-CoV-2, three weeks prior to onset of the neurological symptoms. She did not experience a preceding fever or respiratory symptoms, but a transient loss of smell and taste. At the admission to our neurological department, a progressive proximally pronounced paraparesis, areflexia and sensory loss with tingling of all extremities were found, which began ten days before. The modified Erasmus Giullain-Barre Syndrome outcome score (mEGOS) was 3/9 at admission and 1/12 at day 7 of hospitalization. The electrophysiological assessment proved a segmental demyelinating polyneuropathy and cerebrospinal fluid examination showed an albuminocytologic dissociation. The neurological symptoms improved significantly during treatment with immunoglobulins. INTERPRETATION: Our case draws attention to the occurrence of GBS also in patients with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), who did not experience respiratory or general symptoms.
