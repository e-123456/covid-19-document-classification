Non-infected women with a confirmed pregnancy over 30th gestational week were consecutively included. A patient-reported non-validated questionnaire formed by the expert committee that includes 15 specific questions was used. Non-infected, pregnant women over 30th gestational week who applied to the outpatient clinic were consecutively included.
