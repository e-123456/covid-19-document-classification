We found that the evidence base for current guidelines is sparse, and the available data do not support the 1 - 2 m ( approximately 3 - 6 ft) rule of spatial separation. Of ten studies on horizontal droplet distance, eight showed droplets travel more than 2 m ( approximately 6 ft), in some cases more than 8 meters ( approximately 26 ft).
