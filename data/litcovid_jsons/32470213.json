OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether elevated D-dimer levels could predict mortality in patients with Covid-19. METHODS: Patients with laboratory confirmed Covid-19 were retrospective enrolled in Wuhan Asia General Hospital from January 12, 2020 to March 15, 2020. D-dimer levels on admission, and death events were collected to calculate the optimum cutoff using receiver operating characteristic curve.

The optimum cutoff value of D-dimer to predict in-hospital mortality was 2.0 microg/ml with a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 83.3%.
