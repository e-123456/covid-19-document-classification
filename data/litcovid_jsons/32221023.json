Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, treatment, and disease outcomes of three patients with gynecological malignancies associated with COVID19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University in January 2020, and proposed management strategies for patients with gynecological tumors under risk of COVID19. Results: Three patients were treated COVID19 based on the national diagnosis and treatment protocol as well as research progress. Meanwhile, these patients were appropriately adjusted the treatment plan in accordance with the clinical guidelines for gynecological tumors. Pneumonia was cured in 2 patients, and one patient died of COVID-19. Conclusions: Patients with gynecological malignant tumors are high-risk groups prone to COVID-19 infection, and gynecological oncologists need to carry out education, prevention, control and treatment according to specific conditions.
