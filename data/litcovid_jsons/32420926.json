MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 561 professionals (42.6% males, 26.9% >/= 50-year-old) compiled a specifically designed web questionnaire on characteristics of POC rapid tests. They were asked whether they would change daily practice and make clinical decisions according to POC tests. Multivariate odds ratios (aOR) for predictors of propensity towards the aforementioned behavioral outcomes were calculated through regression analysis. RESULTS: Overall, only 51.9% knew the official recommendations of the Italian Health Authorities for POC tests, while 26.0% of respondents considered POC tests for COVID-19 highly reliable. Still, 40.3% of respondents would change daily practice because of such tests, and 38.5% would make clinical decisions based of their results. Actual understanding of specificity and sensitivity of POC tests was not associated with assessed behavioral outcomes: main positive effectors were identified in perceived reliability and usefulness of rapid tests, acknowledging the existence of official recommendations, understanding the limited clinical implications of POC tests, and working as occupational physicians were characterized as negative effectors. Conclusions. Propensity of sampled professionals towards POC tests for COVID-19 was diffusely unsatisfying. While actual understanding of accuracy of such tests was not a main effector of propensity, previous experiences with other POC tests in daily practice, particularly among occupational physicians may have impaired overall acceptance of such instruments.","Acta Biomed","Ricco, Matteo","Ferraro, Pietro","Gualerzi, Giovanni","Ranzieri, Silvia","Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi","Balzarini, Federica","Signorelli, Carlo","32420926"],"abstract":["INTRODUCTION: The present study aims to characterize knowledge, attitudes and beliefs in a sample of medical professionals towards point-of-care (POC) rapid tests for SARS-CoV-2 in Italy (April 2020).

G6PD deficient individuals are at high risk of severe hemolysis when given anti-malarial drugs such as primaquine, quinine, other sulphonamide-containing medicines, and chloroquine, which has recently been shown to be potent for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We evaluated the geographical accessibility to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana, a malaria-endemic country. METHODS: We obtained the geographic information of 100 randomly sampled clinics previously included in a cross-sectional survey. We also obtained the geolocated data of all public hospitals providing G6PD deficiency testing services in the region. Using ArcGIS 10.5, we quantified geographical access to G6PD deficiency screening test and identified clinics as well as visualize locations with poor access for targeted improvement. The travel time was estimated using an assumed speed of 20 km per hour. FINDINGS: Of the 100 clinics, 58% were Community-based Health Planning and Services facilities, and 42% were sub-district health centers. The majority (92%) were Ghana Health Service facilities, and the remaining 8% were Christian Health Association of Ghana facilities. Access to G6PD deficiency screening test was varied across the districts, and G6PD deficiency screening test was available in all eight public hospitals. This implies that the health facility-to-population ratio for G6PD deficiency testing service was approximately 1:159,210 (8/1,273,677) population. The spatial analysis quantified the current mean distance to a G6PD deficiency testing service from all locations in the region to be 34 +/- 14 km, and travel time (68 +/- 27 min). The estimated mean distance from a clinic to a district hospital for G6PD deficiency testing services was 15 +/- 11 km, and travel time (46 +/- 33 min).

Given the challenges associated with G6PD deficiency, it would be essential to improve access to G6PD deficiency POC testing to facilitate administration of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine to pregnant women, full implementation of the malaria control program in Ghana, and treatment of COVID-19 patients with chloroquine in malaria-endemic countries.
