The LightMix Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene (LN S&W-E) assay was highly sensitive for SARS-CoV-2, as was the N2 set, and both assays had perfectly consistent results with the clinical specimens. While the LM S&W-E set targets the highly conserved region of the E gene in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the N2 set was designed to target the unique region in the SARS-CoV-2 N gene. Thus, the N2 set has high specificity and sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection.
