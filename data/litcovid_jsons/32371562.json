Major health care payors such as Medicare and most private insurance companies have agreed to reimburse health care providers for telemedicine and telephone visits. Methods: The CF adult team at the University of Virginia (UVA) transitioned from face-to-face clinics to multidisciplinary telemedicine clinics by using WebEx((R)) (Cisco Systems, San Jose, CA), a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) compliant platform. Interventions: Patients were contacted before scheduled visits and triaged into: (1) patients eligible for the multidisciplinary telemedicine clinic, (2) patients to be seen in clinic urgently due to acute needs, and (3) stable patients who can be rescheduled at a later time. Ineligible patients for the telemedicine clinic due to lack of access to technology were followed up via telephone. Results: A total of 63 patients were scheduled to be seen in the UVA clinic over 4 weeks, 10 clinic days. Of these patients, 20 (32%) rescheduled their appointment. In addition, 2 patients (3%) were seen in clinic for acute needs and 38 (60%) were seen by the multidisciplinary team through telemedicine. Conclusions: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, implementing a telemedicine clinic process that serves the needs of a multidisciplinary care team is paramount to preserving the CF care model.
