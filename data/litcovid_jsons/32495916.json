METHODS: We describe a patient with COVID-19-induced cytokine storm who developed drug-induced liver injury associated with the use of TCZ. RESULTS: One day after TCZ administration, serum transaminase levels increased 40-fold. Nevertheless, TCZ had a positive effect on clinical and laboratory parameters in cytokine storm, with transaminases values normalizing in 10 days.
