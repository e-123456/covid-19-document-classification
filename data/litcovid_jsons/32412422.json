In the Czech Republic, the first three cases of infection with the novel coronavirus were confirmed on March 1, 2020. The joint effort of state authorities and researchers gave rise to a unique team, which combines methodical knowledge of real-world processes with the know-how needed for effective processing, analysis and online visualization of data. OBJECTIVE: Due to an urgent need for a tool which would make it possible to present important reports, and which would be based on valid data sources only, a team of government experts together with researchers focused on the design and development of a web application intended to provide a regularly updated overview of COVID-19 epidemiology in the Czech Republic to the general public. METHODS: The CRISP-DM (CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) standardized methodology for knowledge mining from database structures was chosen for the complex solution of analytical processing and visualization of data, which provides validated information on the COVID-19 epidemic across the Czech Republic. Great emphasis was put on the understanding and a correct implementation of all six steps (business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation and deployment) needed in the process, including the infrastructure of a nationwide information system, the methodological setting of communication channels between all involved stakeholders, as well as data collection, processing, analysis, validation and visualization. RESULTS: The web-based overview of the current spread of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic has been developed as an online platform providing a set of outputs in the form of tables, graphs and maps intended for the general public. On March 12, 2020, the first version of the web portal, containing fourteen overviews divided into five topical sections, was released. The web portal's primary objective is to publish a well-arranged visualization and clear explanation of basic information consisting of the overall numbers of performed tests, confirmed cases of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related deaths together with the daily and cumulative overviews of COVID-19-positive persons, performed tests, location and country of infection of COVID-19-positive persons, hospitalizations of COVID-19 patients, and distribution of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: The online interactive overview of the current spread of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic was launched on March 11, 2020, and has immediately become the primary communication channel employed by the health care sector to present the current situation regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. This complex reporting of the coronavirus disease epidemic in the Czech Republic also shows an effective way how to interconnect knowledge held by various specialists, such as regional and national methodology experts, who report positive cases of the disease on a daily basis, with knowledge held by developers of central registries, analysts, developers of web applications and leadership in the health care sector.
