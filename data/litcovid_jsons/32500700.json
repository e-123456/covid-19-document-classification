Univariable and multivariate proportional hazards analysis were used to determine the relationship between the CT, laboratory and clinical data and ICU admission and in-hospital death.

Methods: This was a retrospective study performed on 63 Iranian adult patients with a final diagnosis of COVID-19. All patients had undergone chest CT scan on admission.

RESULTS: Thirty-two patients recovered and were discharged during the study period with a median length of admission of 16 days (range, 9 to 25 days), while the rest remained hospitalized at the end of this study (median, 17.5 days; range, 4 to 27 days). None died during the study period. After controlling for age, onset time, lesion characteristics, number of lung lobes affected, and bilateral involvement, the lung severity score on baseline CT (> 4 vs. </= 4 [reference]: adjusted HR = 0.41 [95% confidence interval, CI = 0.18-0.92], p = 0.031) and initial lymphocyte count (reduced vs. normal or elevated [reference]: adjusted HR = 0.14 [95% CI = 0.03-0.60], p = 0.008) were two significant independent factors that influenced recovery and discharge. CONCLUSION: Lung severity score > 4 and reduced lymphocyte count at initial evaluation were independently associated with a significantly lower rate of recovery and discharge and extended hospitalization in patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia."],"journal":"Korean J Radiol","authors":["Liu, Zhe","Jin, Chao","Wu, Carol C","Liang, Ting","Zhao, Huifang","Wang, Yan","Wang, Zekun","Li, Fen","Zhou, Jie","Cai, Shubo","Zeng, Lingxia","Yang, Jian"],"date":"2020-05-16T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32410412","source":"PubMed","week":"202020|May 11 - May 17","doi":"10.3348/kjr.2020.0171","keywords":["2019-ncov","admission","covid-19","ct","clinical course","computed tomography","coronavirus","discharge","hospital stay","hospitalization","outcome","pneumonia","prediction","prognosis","recovery"],"locations":["Pneumonia"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666897319165952000,"score":211.89954}]}
