Kazakhstan's border proximity to China has led to preventive measures in the country since January. This study aims to evaluate the epidemiologic characters of the first recorded cases in Kazakhstan. METHODS: Here, we reviewed the preparedness of the infection control and prevention procedures in Kazakhstan and evaluated the epidemiological characters of confirmed cases in Kazakhstan. The data for COVID-19 cases recorded from March 13 to April 6, 2020, were obtained from the Sanitary Epidemiological Service. Age, gender and their living place were recorded. The severity of infection, geographical distribution, gender and age group of cases were analyzed. RESULTS: Four phases of preventive measures used in respiratory infections have been implemented in Kazakhstan since January 6, 2020. The first case was recorded on March 13. During the period of March 13 and April 06, 629 cases with COVID-19 were recorded in Kazakhstan. Of these, 45 patients recovered, six had resulted in death; 535 (85%) of cases were mild and/or asymptomatic, 72 (11.5%) - moderate, 22 (3.5%) - severe. Of these, 7.5% of the cases were registered as children and course was mild. CONCLUSION: The cases are increasing in Kazakhstan as seen in other countries.
