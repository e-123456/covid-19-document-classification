SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: COVID-19 emergency shocked national health systems, subtracting resources from treatment of other diseases. Its impact on surgical oncology is still to elucidate. METHODS: A 56-question survey regarding the oncological surgical activity in Italy during the COVID-19 emergency was sent to referral centers for hepato-bilio-pancreatic, colorectal, esophago-gastric, and sarcoma/soft-tissue tumors. The survey portrays the situation 5 weeks after the first case of secondary transmission in Italy. RESULTS: In total, 54 surgical Units in 36 Hospitals completed the survey (95%).
