Methods: Viral RNA was extracted in throat swab and sputum sample of the patient and was performed real-time reverse transcription PCR detection and obtained viral genome by high-throughput sequencing method. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using 29 2019-nCoV genomes and 30 beta-coronavirus genomes deposited in NCBI GenBank. Fifteen genomes from Wuhan were grouped by mutation sites and others were identified by Wuhan's or specific mutation sites. Results: A 29 833 bp length genome of the first 2019-nCoV strain in Hangzhou was obtained, covering full length of the coding regions of coronavirus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the genome was closest to the genome of a bat SARS-like coronavirus strain RaTG13 with an identity of 96.11% (28 666/29 826). Among the genes between two genomes, E genes were highly conserved (99.56%), while S genes had lowest identity (92.87%), suggesting that S gene was of a faster evolutionary rate. The genome sequence similarities among 29 strains from China (Hangzhou, Wuhan, and Shenzhen), Japan, USA, and Finland, were all more than 99.9%; however, some single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in some strains. Conclusion: The genome of Hangzhou 2019-nCoV strain was very close to the genomes of strains from other cities in China and overseas collected at early epidemic phase. The 2019-nCoV genome sequencing method used in this paper provides an useful tool for monitoring variation of viral genes.","Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi","Yu, H","Wang, X C","Li, J","Qian, X","Yu, X F","Sun, Z","Chen, J F","Kao, Q J","Wang, H Q","Pan, J C","32171191"],"abstract":["Objective: To understand the viral genomic characteristics of a 2019-nCoV strain in the first COVID-19 patient found in Hangzhou, China.

METHODS: A total of 34 patients were divided into two groups, including those who required noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with additional extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 11 patients. Clinical features of COVID-19 patients were described and the parameters of clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared.

Most patients had lymphocytopenia on admission, with lymphocyte levels dropping progressively on the following days, and the more severe lymphopenia developed in the IMV group.
