We identify the critical steps of the procedure and explain how we overcome the risks associated with breaking the transfer circuit to attach the patient to the theatre ventilator. We explain our technique to reduce secretion spillage when opening the trachea. We emphasise the importance of closed tracheal suctioning and mouth suctioning prior to patient transfer. We highlight the importance of maintaining a closed circuit throughout the procedure and describe tips on how to achieve this. We summarise the steps of our protocol in an \"easy to reproduce\" way.
