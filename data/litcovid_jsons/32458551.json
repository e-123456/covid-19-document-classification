Their age, sex, diagnosis of disease, requirement for emergent intervention, and their medical records about COVID-19 were obtained. There were 390 patients attending to the dermatology outpatient clinic in this period. The most common disease was acne (N:94, 24%), only 19% of patients need emergent interventions or dose adjustment. There were 40 (10%) patients over the age of 65. After their visits, 5 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 in two weeks. Dermatologic examinations may be a vector for SARS-CoV-2 transmission since being closed to the patient. Five of our patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 after their elective visit to hospital. Since the asymptomatic course of some young patients, most of the our patients weren't screened for COVID-19.

By providing a literature overview and sharing practical guidelines, including the special example of Hungarian teledentistry, we present both international and Hungarian initiatives to involve telemedicine on different levels of healthcare systems regarding COVID-19. Both international and national data show that telemedicine can play a major role in the triage process, early identification, diagnosis and treatment of infected individuals, and management of patient pathways in a way that ensures the medical team does not come into contact with potentially infected patients. It also plays an important role in remote monitoring of medical conditions and care of patients with chronic diseases and reconnects vulnerable groups of healthcare personnel to the care system.

However, it is important to emphasize that due to its wide availability, telemedicine services can provide sufficient flexibility for both primary and specialist care (outpatient and inpatient clinical care).
