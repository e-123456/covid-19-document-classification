Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is a high-risk diagnostic-therapeutic procedure in the case of upper GI examinations, and a moderate to low-risk intervention when involving lower GI explorations. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the feces of patients infected with the virus, and occasionally in colonic biopsy samples, has been consistently documented. In fact, viral elimination in the feces may be more prolonged than viral identification in respiratory tract secretions. Furthermore, viral transmission may occur in asymptomatic individuals.
