METHODS: A retrospective study of 100 COVID-19 pneumonia patients without ARDS was performed, and CT scans were reviewed. A COVID-19 pneumonia course diagram was drawn. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the lesion distribution and CT scores, chi(2) test was used to compare the CT findings between different stages. RESULTS: A total of 272 CT scans from 100 patients (mean age, 52.3 years +/- 13.1) were investigated. Four patients with lung abnormalities on CT first showed negative RT-PCR result and turned positive afterwards. One hundred sixty-nine (62.1%) showed predominantly peripheral distribution. The CT scores of the upper zone (3.4 +/- 3.6) were significantly lower than those of the middle (5.0 +/- 3.9) and lower (4.8 +/- 3.6) zones (p < 0.001). The CT scores of the anterior zones (4.9 +/- 4.7) were significantly lower than those of the posterior zones (8.4 +/- 6.2) (p < 0.001).

Two thoracic radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT signs of the lesions and also scored the extent of involvement of the CT signs. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare lesion distribution and CT scores. The chi-square test was used to compare the CT signs of early-phase versus advanced-phase COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS. A total of 62 patients (39 men and 23 women; mean [+/- SD] age, 52.8 +/- 12.2 years; range, 30-77 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Twenty-four of 30 patients who underwent routine blood tests (80.0%) had a decreased lymphocyte count. Of 27 patients who had their erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level assessed, 18 (66.7%) had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and all 27 (100.0%) had an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. Multiple lesions were seen on the initial CT scan of 52 of 62 patients (83.9%). Forty-eight of 62 patients (77.4%) had predominantly peripheral distribution of lesions. The mean CT score for the upper zone (3.0 +/- 3.4) was significantly lower than that for the middle (4.5 +/- 3.8) and lower (4.5 +/- 3.7) zones (p = 0.022 and p = 0.020, respectively), and there was no significant difference in the mean CT score of the middle and lower zones (p = 1.00). The mean CT score for the anterior area (4.4 +/- 4.1) was significantly lower than that for the posterior area (7.7 +/- 6.3) (p = 0.003). CT findings for the patients were as follows: 25 patients (40.3%) had ground-glass opacities (GGO), 21 (33.9%), consolidation; 39 (62.9%), GGO plus a reticular pattern; 34 (54.8%), vacuolar sign; 28 (45.2%), microvascular dilation sign; 35 (56.5%), fibrotic streaks; 21 (33.9%), a subpleural line; and 33 (53.2%), a subpleural transparent line. With regard to bronchial changes seen on CT, 45 patients (72.6%) had air bronchogram, and 11 (17.7%) had bronchus distortion. In terms of pleural changes, CT showed that 30 patients (48.4%) had pleural thickening, 35 (56.5%) had pleural retraction sign, and six (9.7%) had pleural effusion. Compared with early-phase disease (</= 7 days after the onset of symptoms), advanced-phase disease (8-14 days after the onset of symptoms) was characterized by significantly increased frequencies of GGO plus a reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, fibrotic streaks, a subpleural line, a subpleural transparent line, air bronchogram, bronchus distortion, and pleural effusion; however, GGO significantly decreased in advanced-phase disease.

METHODS: 307 patients infected SARS-CoV-2 classified as common type were enrolled in the study. 628 chest CT scans were divided into three groups based on the time interval between symptoms and chest CT scan. The clinical characteristics were descriptively analyzed.The chest CT features were quantitatively evaluated. Mann-Whitney U test was used to test the differences in three groups and between men and women. Spearman rank correlation was used to test the association between the arterial blood gas(ABG) analysis results and chest CT scores. RESULTS: Fever (69.1%) and cough (62.8%) were common symptoms. 111(36.2%) patients were anorexia. GGO was the most common manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia, which could be followed by consolidation and fibrosis. Lower lobe or subpleural region was the most common distribution form of lesion. More lung lobes were involved in the third week. Total chest CT scores in the second week were higher than the first week. Fibrosis Scores increased in the second and third week. Total CT score, GGO score and fibrosis score of male patients were significantly higher than female in the second week. Male patients had higher consolidation score and fibrosis score than female in the third week. Total CT score and GGO score had weak to moderate correlation with arterial blood gas indices. CONCLUSION: Changes in chest CT were difficult to assess quantitatively in the first third weeks. Male patients recovered slower than female in the second week. Although CT score had correlations with arterial blood gas indices, long-term follow-up of pulmonary function test is needed to determine the recovery of lung.","Int J Infect Dis","Shang, Yalei","Xu, Chuanjun","Jiang, Fengli","Huang, Renjun","Li, Yonggang","Zhou, Ying","Xu, Feng","Dai, Hui","32423888"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: The study was aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and evaluate the dynamic changes of chest CT features in the first three weeks in the common type fo COVID-19 pneumonia patients in Jiangsu Province. METHODS: 307 patients infected SARS-CoV-2 classified as common type were enrolled in the study. 628 chest CT scans were divided into three groups based on the time interval between symptoms and chest CT scan. The clinical characteristics were descriptively analyzed.The chest CT features were quantitatively evaluated. Mann-Whitney U test was used to test the differences in three groups and between men and women. Spearman rank correlation was used to test the association between the arterial blood gas(ABG) analysis results and chest CT scores. RESULTS: Fever (69.1%) and cough (62.8%) were common symptoms. 111(36.2%) patients were anorexia. GGO was the most common manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia, which could be followed by consolidation and fibrosis. Lower lobe or subpleural region was the most common distribution form of lesion. More lung lobes were involved in the third week. Total chest CT scores in the second week were higher than the first week. Fibrosis Scores increased in the second and third week. Total CT score, GGO score and fibrosis score of male patients were significantly higher than female in the second week. Male patients had higher consolidation score and fibrosis score than female in the third week. Total CT score and GGO score had weak to moderate correlation with arterial blood gas indices. CONCLUSION: Changes in chest CT were difficult to assess quantitatively in the first third weeks. Male patients recovered slower than female in the second week. Although CT score had correlations with arterial blood gas indices, long-term follow-up of pulmonary function test is needed to determine the recovery of lung."],"journal":"Int J Infect Dis","authors":["Shang, Yalei","Xu, Chuanjun","Jiang, Fengli","Huang, Renjun","Li, Yonggang","Zhou, Ying","Xu, Feng","Dai, Hui"],"date":"2020-05-20T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32423888","source":"PubMed","week":"202021|May 18 - May 24","doi":"10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.006","keywords":["covid-19","ct","sars-cov-2","change","chest"],"locations":["Jiangsu","Jiangsu","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1667252837808078848,"score":295.75775}]}
