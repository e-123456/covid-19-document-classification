We report the dynamics of peripheral immune cells, cytokines, and human leucocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) and its receptor expressions in a patient suffering from critical COVID-19 pneumonia to convalescence. Methods: Clinical data of the patient were collected from medical records. The expressions of HLA-G and receptors ILT2, ILT4 and KIR2DL4 in peripheral immune cells were measured with flow cytometry. Results: From critical COVID-19 to the convalescent stage, early lymphopenia was improved (median: 0.6 x 10(9) L(-1) vs. 0.9 x 10(9) L(-1), P = 0.009), and an obvious fluctuation in WBC and neutrophil counts was observed. Initially, low levels of CD4(+) T cells (from 120 to 528 muL(-1)) and CD8(+) T cells (from 68 to 362 muL(-1)) gradually increased to normal levels.

Results: Of the 157 pediatric patients with COVID-19, 60 (38.2%) had mild clinical type with pneumonia, 88 (56.1%) had moderate cases, 6 (3.8%) had severe cases, and 3 (1.9%) were critically ill. The 148 children with mild or moderate disease had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 84 (18-123) months, and 88 (59.5%) were girls. The most common laboratory abnormalities were increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (median [IQR], 16.0 [12.0-26.0] U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (median [IQR], 30.0 [23.0-41.8] U/L), creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) activity (median [IQR], 24.0 [18.0-34.0] U/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (median [IQR], 243.0 [203.0-297.0] U/L), which are associated with liver and myocardial injury. Compared with mild cases, levels of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interferon gamma were unchanged, whereas the level of immune suppressive interleukin 10 was markedly increased in moderate cases compared with mild cases (median [IQR], 3.96 [3.34-5.29] pg/mL vs 3.58 [3.10-4.36] pg/mL; P = .048). There was no statistically significant difference in absolute number of lymphocytes (including T cells and B cells) between mild and moderate cases, but moderate cases were associated with a decrease in neutrophil levels compared with mild cases (median [IQR], 2310/muL [1680/muL-3510/muL] vs 3120/muL [2040/muL-4170/muL]; P = .01).

Immunoglobin G and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio were negatively associated with biochemical indices related to liver and myocardial injury (immunoglobulin G, ALT: r, -0.3579; AST: r, -0.5280; CK-MB activity: r, -0.4786; LDH: r, -0.4984; and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, ALT: r, -0.1893; AST: r, -0.3912; CK-MB activity: r, -0.3428; LDH: r, -0.3234), while counts of lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and interleukin 10 showed positive associations (lymphocytes, ALT: r, 0.2055; AST: r, 0.3615; CK-MB activity: r, 0.338; LDH: r, 0.3309; CD4+ T cells, AST: r, 0.4701; CK-MB activity: r, 0.4151; LDH: r, 0.4418; interleukin 10, ALT: r, 0.2595; AST: r, 0.3386; CK-MB activity: r, 0.3948; LDH: r, 0.3794). Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series, systemic inflammation rarely occurred in pediatric patients with COVID-19, in contrast with the lymphopenia and aggravated inflammatory responses frequently observed in adults with COVID-19. Gaining a deeper understanding of the role of neutrophils, CD4+ T cells, and B cells in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be important for the clinical management of COVID-19."],"journal":"JAMA Netw Open","authors":["Wu, Huan","Zhu, Hongmin","Yuan, Chunhui","Yao, Cong","Luo, Wei","Shen, Xin","Wang, Jun","Shao, Jianbo","Xiang, Yun"],"date":"2020-06-04T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32492165","source":"PubMed","week":"202023|Jun 01 - Jun 07","doi":"10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.10895","locations":["neutrophil","Wuhan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Treatment","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1668623433597976576,"score":298.97015},{"pmid":32425950,"pmcid":"PMC7205903","title":"Reduction and Functional Exhaustion of T Cells in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).","text":["Reduction and Functional Exhaustion of T Cells in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed great threat to human health. T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the counts of T cells and serum cytokine concentration from data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and 40 healthy controls. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers were measured in 14 COVID-19 cases. Results: The number of total T cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8(+) T cells or CD4(+) T cells lower than 800, 300, or 400/muL, respectively, were negatively correlated with patient survival. T cell numbers were negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha concentration, with patients in the disease resolution period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha concentrations and restored T cell counts. T cells from COVID-19 patients had significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1. Increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells was seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages. Conclusions: T cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted.
