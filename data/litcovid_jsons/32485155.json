METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured with the Elecsys(R) assay and the EDI(TM) ELISAs (IgM and IgG) in 64 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients with serial blood samples (n=104) collected at different time points from symptom onset. Blood samples from 200 healthy blood donors and 256 intensive care unit (ICU) patients collected before the COVID-19 outbreak were also used. RESULTS: In COVID-19 patients, the percentage of positive results rose with time from symptom onset, peaking to positivity rates after 15-22 days of 100% for the Elecsys(R) assay, of 94% for the EDI(TM) IgM-ELISA and of 100% for the EDI(TM) IgG ELISA.
