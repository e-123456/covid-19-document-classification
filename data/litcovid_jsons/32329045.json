This gap will increase with the current pandemic due to COVID-19. AIM: To evaluate the current availability of digital health tools for the care of people with epilepsy according to the world medical literature and their use during said pandemic. DEVELOPMENT: We reviewed the publications in scientific journals in the last decade that had as their main topic the use of digital health tools or telemedicine focused on the care of patients with epilepsy, including 4 months after the national quarantines due to the appearance of the virus SARS-CoV-2. Seventeen publications were found on the use of telemedicine focused on epilepsy. The most widely used tools internationally are online platforms, followed by mobile applications, videoconferences, epileptic seizure capture systems, checklists, algorithms for understanding medical data, phone calls, tele-encephalography and text messages. None was published during the COVID-19 current pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is little literature on the use of digital health tools focused on epilepsy, there are several that can be used to fight the attention gap, especially in this global pandemic by COVID-19 that forces quarantines of people and communities for long periods. It is necessary to remove barriers and facilitate patient access to these new information technologies.","Rev Neurol","Santos-Peyret, A","Duron, R M","Sebastian-Diaz, M A","Crail-Melendez, D","Gomez-Ventura, S","Briceno-Gonzalez, E","Rito, Y","Martinez-Juarez, I E","32329045"],"abstract":["INTRODUCTION: Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder that affects around 50 million worldwide and there is an abundance of literature on the health care gap for this sector of the population.

The pandemic crisis presents some unique challenges for patients currently being treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS). Movement disorder (Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia), neuropsychiatric disorder (obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, depression), and epilepsy patients can develop varying degrees of symptom worsening from interruption of therapy due to neurostimulator battery reaching end of life, device malfunction or infection. Urgent intervention to maintain or restore stimulation may be required for patients with Parkinson's disease who can develop a rare but potentially life-threatening complication known as DBS-withdrawal syndrome. Similarly, patients with generalized dystonia can develop status dystonicus, patients with obsessive compulsive disorder can become suicidal, and epilepsy patients can experience potentially life-threatening worsening of seizures as a result of therapy cessation. DBS system infection can require urgent, and rarely emergent surgery. Elective interventions including new implantations and initial programming should be postponed. For patients with existing DBS systems, the battery status and electrical integrity interrogation can now be performed using patient programmers, and employed through telemedicine visits or by phone consultations. The decision for replacement of the implantable pulse generator to prevent interruption of DBS therapy should be made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration battery status and a patient's tolerance to potential therapy disruption. Scheduling of the procedures, however, depends heavily on the hospital system regulations and on triage procedures with respect to safety and resource utilization during the health crisis.","J Parkinsons Dis","Miocinovic, Svjetlana","Ostrem, Jill L","Okun, Michael S","Bullinger, Katie L","Riva-Posse, Patricio","Gross, Robert E","Buetefisch, Cathrin M","32333552"],"abstract":["Most medical centers are postponing elective procedures and deferring non-urgent clinic visits to conserve hospital resources and prevent spread of COVID-19.

Symptomatic patients were triaged into one of four categories-emergent, urgent, non-urgent or self-care- and then connected with the appropriate level of care via direct scheduling or telephone hotline. RESULTS: This self-triage and self-scheduling tool was designed and implemented in under two weeks. During the first 16 days of use, it was completed 1129 times by 950 unique patients. Of completed sessions, 315 (28%) were by asymptomatic patients, and 814 (72%) were by symptomatic patients.
