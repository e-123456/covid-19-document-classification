This commentary offers patient counseling recommendations based on the current available evidence. While there are currently no specific data for psoriasis biologics and COVID-19, data are presented here from phase III clinical trials of psoriasis biologics on rates of upper respiratory infection, influenza, and serious infection. Overall these data reveal that on the whole, psoriasis biologics do not show major increases in infection risk compared to placebo during the course of these trials. However, as the COVID-19 virus is a novel pathogen that is associated with mortality in a subset of patients, a cautious approach is warranted. We discuss factors that may alter the benefit-risk ratio of biologic use during this time of COVID-19 outbreak. Ultimately, treatment decisions should be made on the basis of dialogue between patient and provider, considering each patient's individualized situation. Once this pandemic has passed, it is only a matter of time before a new viral disease reignites the same issues discussed here.","Dermatol Ther (Heidelb)","Brownstone, Nicholas D","Thibodeaux, Quinn G","Reddy, Vidhatha D","Myers, Bridget A","Chan, Stephanie Y","Bhutani, Tina","Liao, Wilson","32300516"],"abstract":["With the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) viral pandemic, there is uncertainty whether biologic agents for psoriasis may place patients at a higher risk for infection or more severe disease course.
