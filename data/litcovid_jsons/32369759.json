OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine how Internet use, risk awareness, and demographic characteristics are associated with engagement in preventative behaviors and testing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

RESULTS: Our data included 979 valid responses from the U.S. Participants who received more COVID-19-related health information online reported more frequent effort to engage in all types of preventive behaviors: wearing a facemask in public (odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95% CI 1.34-1.79P < .001), washing hands (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.35-1.85, P < .001), covering nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.52-2.10, P < .001), keeping social distance with others (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.21-1.65, P < .001), staying home (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.20-1.62, P < .001), avoiding using public transportation (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32-1.88, P < .001), and cleaning frequently used surfaces (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.34-1.79, P < .001).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to apply rapid online surveying to determine knowledge and perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the general public in the United States and the United Kingdom. METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to 3000 adults residing in the United States and 3000 adults residing in the United Kingdom who had registered with Prolific Academic to participate in online research. Prolific Academic established strata by age (18-27, 28-37, 38-47, 48-57, or >/=58 years), sex (male or female), and ethnicity (white, black or African American, Asian or Asian Indian, mixed, or \"other\"), as well as all permutations of these strata.

Of those, 64.4% (1924/2986) of US participants and 51.5% (1540/2988) of UK participants had a tertiary education degree, 67.5% (2015/2986) of US participants had a total household income between US $20,000 and US $99,999, and 74.4% (2223/2988) of UK participants had a total household income between pound15,000 and pound74,999. US and UK participants' median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 5.0% (IQR 2.0%-15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR 2.0%-10.0%), respectively.

The present study sought to determine knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of health care workers (HCWs) toward COVID-19 in Makerere University Teaching Hospitals (MUTHs) in Uganda. Methods: An online cross sectional, descriptive study was undertaken through WhatsApp Messenger among HCWs in four MUTHs. HCWs aged 18 years and above constituted the study population. KAP toward COVID-19 was assessed by using a pre-validated questionnaire. Bloom's cut-off of 80% was used to determine sufficient knowledge (>/=80%), positive attitude (>/=4), and good practice (>/=2.4). All analyses were performed using STATA 15.1 and GraphPad Prism 8.3. Results: Of the 581 HCWs approached, 136 (23%) responded. A vast majority of the participants were male (n = 87, n = 64%), with a median age of 32 (range: 20-66) years. Eighty-four (62%) were medical doctors and 125 (92%) had at least a bachelor's degree. Overall, 69% (n = 94) had sufficient knowledge, 21% (n = 29) had positive attitude, and 74% (n = 101) had good practices toward COVID-19. Factors associated with knowledge were age >40 years (aOR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1-1.0; p = 0.047) and news media (aOR: 4.8; 95% CI: 1.4-17.0; p = 0.015). Factors associated with good practices were age 40 years or more (aOR: 48.4; 95% CI: 3.1-742.9; p = 0.005) and holding a diploma (aOR: 18.4; 95% CI: 1-322.9; p = 0.046). Conclusions: Continued professional education is advised among HCWs in Uganda to improve knowledge of HCWs hence averting negative attitudes and promoting positive preventive and therapeutic practices. We recommend follow up studies involving teaching and non-teaching hospitals across the country.","Front Public Health","Olum, Ronald","Chekwech, Gaudencia","Wekha, Godfrey","Nassozi, Dianah Rhoda","Bongomin, Felix","32426320"],"abstract":["Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging public health problem threatening the life of over 2.4 million people globally. The present study sought to determine knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of health care workers (HCWs) toward COVID-19 in Makerere University Teaching Hospitals (MUTHs) in Uganda. Methods: An online cross sectional, descriptive study was undertaken through WhatsApp Messenger among HCWs in four MUTHs. HCWs aged 18 years and above constituted the study population. KAP toward COVID-19 was assessed by using a pre-validated questionnaire. Bloom's cut-off of 80% was used to determine sufficient knowledge (>/=80%), positive attitude (>/=4), and good practice (>/=2.4). All analyses were performed using STATA 15.1 and GraphPad Prism 8.3. Results: Of the 581 HCWs approached, 136 (23%) responded. A vast majority of the participants were male (n = 87, n = 64%), with a median age of 32 (range: 20-66) years. Eighty-four (62%) were medical doctors and 125 (92%) had at least a bachelor's degree. Overall, 69% (n = 94) had sufficient knowledge, 21% (n = 29) had positive attitude, and 74% (n = 101) had good practices toward COVID-19. Factors associated with knowledge were age >40 years (aOR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1-1.0; p = 0.047) and news media (aOR: 4.8; 95% CI: 1.4-17.0; p = 0.015). Factors associated with good practices were age 40 years or more (aOR: 48.4; 95% CI: 3.1-742.9; p = 0.005) and holding a diploma (aOR: 18.4; 95% CI: 1-322.9; p = 0.046). Conclusions: Continued professional education is advised among HCWs in Uganda to improve knowledge of HCWs hence averting negative attitudes and promoting positive preventive and therapeutic practices.
