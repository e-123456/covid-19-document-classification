For approval, median votes were required to meet pre-defined levels of agreement (median values of 7-9, 4-6, and 1-3 defined as \"agreement\", \"uncertainty\" or \"disagreement\", respectively) with either moderate or high levels of consensus. RESULTS: The task force approved 77 initial guidance statements, 36 with moderate and 41 with high consensus. These were combined, resulting in 25 final guidance statements.
