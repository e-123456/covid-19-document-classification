In this paper we aim to describe the main pharmacological properties, including data on mechanism of action, safety concerns and drug-drug interactions, of drugs currently administered in patients with COVID-19, focusing on antivirals and drugs with immune-modulatory and/or anti-inflammatory properties. Where available, data from clinical trials involving patients with COVID-19 were reported. Several studies have been registered worldwide and a number of drugs were repurposed to face the new health emergency of COVID-19. For many of these drugs, including lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir and tocilizumab, preliminary clinical trials seem to support their benefit in improving patients' clinical conditions. However, adequate clinical trials are necessary to reach any firm conclusion on the efficacy and safety profiles of these compounds. Even though drug repurposing is necessary, it requires caution. Too many drugs that are currently tested in patients with COVID-19 have peculiar safety profiles. In conclusion, while waiting for the development of effective preventive measures, such as vaccines, many clinical trials on drugs belonging to different therapeutic classes are currently underway.
