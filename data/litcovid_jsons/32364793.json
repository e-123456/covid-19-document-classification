In March 2020, institutions in the United States began to implement a range of policies to discourage direct contact and encourage social distancing. These measures have placed us in an unprecedented position where education can no longer occur at close quarters - most notably, around a multi-headed microscope - but must instead continue at a distance. This guide is intended to be a resource for pathologists and pathologists-in-training who wish to leverage technology to continue collaboration, teaching, and education in this era. The manuscript is focused mainly on anatomic pathology; however, the technologies easily lend themselves to clinical pathology education as well. Our aim is to provide curated lists of various online resources that can be used for virtual learning in pathology, provide tips and tricks, and share our personal experience with these technologies. The lists include video conferencing platforms, pathology websites, free online educational resources, including social media, and whole-slide imaging collections. We are currently living through a unique situation without a precedent or guidebook, and we hope that this guide will enable the community of pathology educators worldwide to embrace the opportunities that 21st century technology provides.","Arch Pathol Lab Med","Mukhopadhyay, Sanjay","Booth, Adam L","Calkins, Sarah M","Doxtader, Erika E","Fine, Samson W","Gardner, Jerad M","Gonzalez, Raul S","Mirza, Kamran M","Jiang, Xiaoyin Sara","32364793"],"abstract":["The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly disrupted traditional modes of operation in healthcare and education.
