OBJECTIVE: We will describe the medical activities and the difficulties of the cruise ship quarantine. METHODS: Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 were performed on all 3,711 persons (2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew). RESULTS: Six-hundred ninety-six (18.8%) reported positive, of which 410 (58.9%) were asymptomatic. We also confirmed that 54% of the asymptomatic patient with RT-PCR-positive had lung opacities when they have a chest CT (Computed tomography). There were many difficulties onboard, such as creating a dividing traffic line between infectious and non-infectious passengers, finding hospitals and transportation willing to accept these patients, transporting individuals, language barriers, and supporting daily life. As of March 8, thirty-one patients (4.5% of RT-PCR test positives) were hospitalized requiring ventilator support or intensive care, and seven patients (1.0% of RT-PCR test positives) died. CONCLUSIONS: There were several difficulties in terms of large-scale quarantine and medical support on the cruise ship. We need to prepare the patients' transfer and admitting hospitals when disembarking the passengers. We recommend treating the crew as same as the passengers with the infection control principle.

On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on cruise ship Diamond Princess was reported with 10 initial cases, following an index case on board around 21-25 January. By 4 February, public health measures such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine of non-ill passengers were implemented. By 20 February, 619 of 3,700 passengers and crew (17%) were tested positive. METHODS: We estimated the basic reproduction number from the initial period of the outbreak using (SEIR) models. We calibrated the models with transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data. We additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures, and established a model stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of differential contact rates among the groups. We also compared scenarios of an earlier versus later evacuation of the ship. RESULTS: The basic reproduction rate was initially 4 times higher on-board compared to the ${R}_0$ in the epicentre in Wuhan, but the countermeasures lowered it substantially. Based on the modeled initial ${R}_0$ of 14.8, we estimated that without any interventions within the time period of 21 January to 19 February, 2920 out of the 3700 (79%) would have been infected. Isolation and quarantine therefore prevented 2307 cases, and lowered the ${R}_0$ to 1.78. We showed that an early evacuation of all passengers on 3 February would have been associated with 76 infected persons in their incubation time. CONCLUSIONS: The cruise ship conditions clearly amplified an already highly transmissible disease. The public health measures prevented more than 2000 additional cases compared to no interventions. However, evacuating all passengers and crew early on in the outbreak would have prevented many more passengers and crew from infection.","J Travel Med","Rocklov, J","Sjodin, H","Wilder-Smith, A","32109273"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Cruise ships carry a large number of people in confined spaces with relative homogeneous mixing.
