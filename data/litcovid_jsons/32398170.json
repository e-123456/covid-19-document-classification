The objective of this study was to determine the stability of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in specimen transport media under various storage conditions. Transport medium tested included: VCM, UTM(R)-RT, ESwab, M4 and saline (0.9% NaCl). Specimen types tested included Nasopharyngeal/Oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs in the above transport media, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and Sputum. A high-titer SARS-CoV-2 remnant patient specimen was spiked into pooled SARS-CoV-2 RNA-negative specimen remnants for the various media types. Aliquots of samples were stored at 18 degrees C to 25 degrees C, 2 degrees C to 8 degrees C and -10 degrees C to -30 degrees C and then tested at time points up to 14 days. Specimens consistently yielded amplifiable RNA with mean Ct differences of <3 over the various conditions assayed, thus supporting the use and transport of alternative collection media and specimen types under a variety of temperature storage conditions.","J Clin Microbiol","Rogers, Amy A","Baumann, Russell E","Borillo, Gwynngelle A","Kagan, Ron M","Batterman, Hollis J","Galdzicka, Marzena","Marlowe, Elizabeth M","32341141"],"abstract":["The global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a worldwide shortage of viral transport media and raised questions about specimen stability.
