Methods Data were downloaded from Seoul Data Open Plaza, and changes in the number of passengers on the Seoul Metropolitan Subway network between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2020, were used to assess the extent to which people in Seoul practiced social distancing. Five events regarding COVID-19 that received wide public attention between January and March 2020 were identified and the changes in the number of passengers before and after each event were analyzed. Also, similar analyses were performed for 16 stations that were specific in either the age or purpose of the visit of the passengers.

The percentage decrease in individual stations between this period was not significantly different between \"young\" and \"old\" stations (46.3% vs. 49.2%; p = 0.551) but was significantly smaller in \"work\" stations than in \"leisure\" stations (36.2% vs. 51.6%; p = 0.021).
