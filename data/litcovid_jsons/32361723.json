RESULTS: Of 140 patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia, 72 (51.4%) were men, with a median age of 60 years. Patients with SpO2 values of 90% or less were older and were more likely to be men, to have hypertension, and to present with dyspnea than those with SpO2 values greater than 90%.

The validation cohort included 710 patients with a mean (SD) age of 48.2 (15.2) years, and 382 (53.8%) were men and 172 (24.2%). From 72 potential predictors, 10 variables were independent predictive factors and were included in the risk score: chest radiographic abnormality (OR, 3.39; 95% CI, 2.14-5.38), age (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05), hemoptysis (OR, 4.53; 95% CI, 1.36-15.15), dyspnea (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.18-3.01), unconsciousness (OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.39-15.98), number of comorbidities (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.27-2.00), cancer history (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.23-13.43), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10), lactate dehydrogenase (OR, 1.002; 95% CI, 1.001-1.004) and direct bilirubin (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.24). The mean AUC in the development cohort was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.85-0.91) and the AUC in the validation cohort was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.93). The score has been translated into an online risk calculator that is freely available to the public (http://118.126.104.170/). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, a risk score based on characteristics of COVID-19 patients at the time of admission to the hospital was developed that may help predict a patient's risk of developing critical illness."],"journal":"JAMA Intern Med","authors":["Liang, Wenhua","Liang, Hengrui","Ou, Limin","Chen, Binfeng","Chen, Ailan","Li, Caichen","Li, Yimin","Guan, Weijie","Sang, Ling","Lu, Jiatao","Xu, Yuanda","Chen, Guoqiang","Guo, Haiyan","Guo, Jun","Chen, Zisheng","Zhao, Yi","Li, Shiyue","Zhang, Nuofu","Zhong, Nanshan","He, Jianxing"],"date":"2020-05-13T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32396163","source":"PubMed","week":"202020|May 11 - May 17","doi":"10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.2033","locations":["China","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Diagnosis","Treatment"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666627828016218113,"score":225.61583}]}
