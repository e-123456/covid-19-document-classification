The first was \"How should we/clinicians modify our clinical care pathway for people with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic?\" The second was \"What general advice should we give to people with epilepsy during this crisis? Authors individually scored statements on a scale of -10 (strongly disagree) to +10 (strongly agree). 5/11 recommendations for physicians and 3/5 recommendations for individuals/families were rated by all authors as 7 or above (strongly agree) on the first round of rating. Subsequently, a tele-conference was held where statements for which there was a lack of strong consensus were revised. RESULTS: After revision, all consensus recommendations received a score of 7 or above. The recommendations focus on administration of as much care as possible at home to keep people with epilepsy out of health care facilities, where they are likely to encounter COVID-19 (including strategies for rescue therapy), as well as minimization of risk of seizure exacerbation through adherence, and through ensuring a regular supply of medication. We also provide helpful links to additional helpful information for people with epilepsy and health providers.
