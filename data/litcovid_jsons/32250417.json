Urologic surgical emergencies arise and exceptional urologic care must continue to be provided. Despite lower surgical volumes and the inability for teams to meet in person, there are still robust opportunities for urologic surgical residents and faculty to maintain their surgical skills and mental sharpness.

By March 6, seven residents of this second facility were symptomatic and had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2.
