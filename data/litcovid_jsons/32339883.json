We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioural changes of the public on the incidence of COVID-19, as well as on influenza virus infections, which might share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. METHODS: We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 to estimate changes in transmissibility over time. Attitudes towards COVID-19 and changes in population behaviours were reviewed through three telephone surveys done on Jan 20-23, Feb 11-14, and March 10-13, 2020. FINDINGS: COVID-19 transmissibility measured by Rt has remained at approximately 1 for 8 weeks in Hong Kong. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% CI 34-53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, from an estimated Rt of 1.28 (95% CI 1.26-1.30) before the start of the school closures to 0.72 (0.70-0.74) during the closure weeks. Similarly, a 33% (24-43%) reduction in transmissibility was seen based on paediatric hospitalisation rates, from an Rt of 1.10 (1.06-1.12) before the start of the school closures to 0.73 (0.68-0.77) after school closures. Among respondents to the surveys, 74.5%, 97.5%, and 98.8% reported wearing masks when going out, and 61.3%, 90.2%, and 85.1% reported avoiding crowded places in surveys 1 (n=1008), 2 (n=1000), and 3 (n=1005), respectively. INTERPRETATION: Our study shows that non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, distancing, and changes in population behaviour) were associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and are also likely to have substantially reduced influenza transmission in early February, 2020.

Methods: Viral RNA was extracted in throat swab and sputum sample of the patient and was performed real-time reverse transcription PCR detection and obtained viral genome by high-throughput sequencing method. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using 29 2019-nCoV genomes and 30 beta-coronavirus genomes deposited in NCBI GenBank. Fifteen genomes from Wuhan were grouped by mutation sites and others were identified by Wuhan's or specific mutation sites.
