Discrepant SARS-CoV-2 results were resolved by testing the N, ORF1b, ORF1ab and M genes. RESULTS: Of 52 clinical samples collected from 50 persons tested, respiratory viruses were detected in 22 samples (42 %), including SARS CoV-2 (n=5), rhinovirus (n=7), enterovirus (n=5), influenza B (n=4), hMPV (n=5), influenza A (n=2), PIV-2 (n=1), RSV (n=2), CoV-NL63 (n=1) and CoV-229E (n=1).
