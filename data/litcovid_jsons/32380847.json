TCMSP and TCMIP V2.0 server were used to predict all chemical components and action targets of Qingwen Baidu Yin. Diseases that could be treated by Qingwen Baidu Yin were predicted through Enrichr database. A compound target interaction(PPI) network diagram was constructed using STRING 11.0. OmicShare was used to analyzed the gene ontology(GO) enrichment and enrichment of the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes(KEGG) pathway of core targets. Component-target-path network diagram was constructed with Cytoscape 3.6.0 software. After analysis of the database, 267 compounds were screened for Qingwen Baidu Yin, involving 1 450 targets, and a protein interaction network was constructed. Total 219 core target proteins were predicted, such as NFKB1, STAT1, RAF1, IL2, JAK1, IL6, TNF, BCL2 and other important targets, and 221 core target pathways were enriched, including cancer pathway, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus infection, chemokine signal pathway, PI3 K-AKT signal pathway, EB virus infection, virus carcinogenesis and T cell receptor signaling pathways, a collection of which were highly related to cytokine storms. GO annotation analysis suggested that Qingwen Baidu Yin Decoction may exert therapeutic effects by regulating protein phosphorylation, cell response to cytokine stimulation, cell proliferation, inflammatory response, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways.
