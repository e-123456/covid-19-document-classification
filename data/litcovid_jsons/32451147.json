Analysis compared responses by diagnosis, disease activity, and new onset of symptoms. Qualitative analysis was conducted on optional free-text comment fields. RESULTS: Of the 7,061 participants invited, 530 responded, with RA the most frequent diagnosis (61%). Eleven met COVID-19 screening criteria, of which two sought testing unsuccessfully. Six others sought testing, three were successful, and all were negative. Not quite half (42%) reported a change to their care in the prior two weeks.
