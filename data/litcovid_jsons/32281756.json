Piacenza is only 15 km away from the main cluster of cases in the country (Codogno, in the Lodi province) and, after the closure of the Hospital in Codogno, saw an escalation in the number of patients testing positive to Covid-19. The authors describe their efforts and the practices they adopted to contain the spread of the disease among inpatients visiting the hospital's Hemodialysis Clinic. They also reflect on some of the data available on the 25/03/2020, such as the number of patients testing positive and the mortality rate, unfortunately very high.
