The status of non-emergency dental services, emergency dental services, and online professional consultation and the hospitals' geographical distribution were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: All the 48 public tertiary dental hospitals suspended general non-emergency dental treatment while providing emergency dental services only. Ninety percent of them notified the change of dental services online, and 69% of them offered free online professional consultations. The penetration rate of online technology was significantly higher in the eastern region than that of the central and western regions. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant change in the health service provision of Chinese public tertiary dental hospitals during the COVID-19 epidemic and wider use of telehealth in the eastern region.
