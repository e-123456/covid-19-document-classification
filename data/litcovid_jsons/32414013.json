We conducted quota sampling based on the proportion of the population in each province and gender ratios in the Sixth Census and obtained a sample size of 3837. Government intervention was divided into government communication, government prevention and control, and government rescue. We used multiple regression and a bootstrap mediation effect test to study the mechanism of these three forms of government intervention on the public's adoption of PARs. The results show that government prevention and control and government rescue significantly increased the likelihood of the public adopting PARs. Risk perception was significantly associated with the public's adoption of PARs. The effects of government interventions and risk perception on the public's adoption of PARs was not found to vary by region. Risk perception is identified as an important mediating factor between government intervention and the public's adoption of PARs. These results indicate that increasing the public's risk perception is an effective strategy for governments seeking to encourage the public to adopt PARs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Int J Environ Res Public Health","Duan, Taixiang","Jiang, Hechao","Deng, Xiangshu","Zhang, Qiongwen","Wang, Fang","32414013"],"abstract":["This study examines the relationships between government interventions, risk perception, and the public's adoption of protective action recommendations (PARs) during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease emergency in mainland China.

METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected from 501 participants who were >/=18 years. Exposure to COVID-19 news was assessed as our exposure variable.

China has experienced the unprecedented epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in an era when social media has fundamentally transformed information production and consumption patterns. OBJECTIVE: This study examined public engagement and government responsiveness in the communications about COVID-19 during the early epidemic stage based on analysis of data from Sina Weibo, a major social media platform in China. METHODS: Weibo data relevant to COVID-19 from December 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020 were retrieved. Engagement data (Likes, Comments, Shares and Followers) of posts from government agency accounts were extracted to evaluate public engagement with government posts online. Content analyses were conducted for a random subset of 644 posts from personal accounts of individuals, and 273 posts from 10 relatively more active government agency accounts and the National Health Commission of China to identify major thematic contents in online discussions. Latent class analysis (LCA) was employed to further explore main content patterns while Chi-square for trend examined how proportions of main content patterns changed by time within the study timeframe. RESULTS: Public response to COVID-19 seemed to follow the spread of the disease and government actions but was earlier on Weibo than the government. Online users generally had low engagement with posts relevant COVID-19 from government agency accounts. The common content patterns identified in personal and government posts included sharing epidemic situation, general knowledge of the new disease, and policies, guidelines and official actions. However, personal posts more likely showed empathy to affected people (chi-square=13.3, P<.001), attributed blame to other individuals or government (chi-square=28.9, P<.001), and expressed worry about the epidemic (chi-square=32.1, P<.001) while government posts more likely shared instrumental support (chi-square=32.5, P<.001) and praised people or organizations (chi-square=8.7, P=.003). As the epidemic evolved, sharing situation update (chi-square for trend=19.7, P<.001), and policies, guidelines and official actions (chi-square for trend=15.3, P<.001) became less frequent in personal posts but remained stable or increased significantly in government posts. Moreover, as the epidemic evolved, showing empathy and attributing blame (chi-square for trend=25.3, P<.001) became more frequent in personal posts, corresponding to a slight increase in sharing instrumental support, praising and empathy in government posts (chi-square for trend=9.0, P=.003). CONCLUSIONS: The government should closely monitor social media data to improve the timing of communications about an epidemic.
