METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (age>/=18years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without Invasive ventilation, diagnosed between Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 13, 2020.

Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups. FINDINGS: 81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled.
