METHODS: For each of 1476 consecutive patients with COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China, nadir platelet count during hospitalization was retrospectively collected and categorized into (0, 50], (50, 100], (100 - 150] or (150 - ) group after taking the unit (x 10(9/L) ) away from the report of nadir platelet count.
