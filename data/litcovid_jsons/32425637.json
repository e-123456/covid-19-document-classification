The baseline and follow-up surveys were conducted from February 25-27, 2020 and April 1-6, 2020, respectively. Participants were asked how often they implemented the 5 personal protective measures recommended by the World Health Organization (hand hygiene, social distancing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, respiratory etiquette, and self-isolation) in the baseline and follow-up surveys. Results: The prevalence of 3 of the 5 personal protective measures significantly improved in the community transmission phase compared to the early phase. Social distancing measures showed significant improvement, from 67.4% to 82.2%. However, the prevalence of avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, which had the lowest prevalence in the early phase, showed no significant improvement (approximately 60%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed, men and persons of low-income households made fewer improvements than women and persons of high-income households. Conclusions: The prevalence of personal protective measures by ordinary citizens is improving, however there is potential for improvement, especially in regard to avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth.","Int J Infect Dis","Machida, Masaki","Nakamura, Itaru","Saito, Reiko","Nakaya, Tomoki","Hanibuchi, Tomoya","Takamiya, Tomoko","Odagiri, Yuko","Fukushima, Noritoshi","Kikuchi, Hiroyuki","Amagasa, Shiho","Kojima, Takako","Watanabe, Hidehiro","Inoue, Shigeru","32425637"],"abstract":["Objectives: To clarify changes in the implementation of personal protective measures among ordinary Japanese citizens from the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak to the community transmission phase.

Mitigation strategies include personal protective measures (e.g., handwashing, cough etiquette, and face coverings) that persons can use at home or while in community settings; social distancing (e.g., maintaining physical distance between persons in community settings and staying at home); and environmental surface cleaning at home and in community settings, such as schools or workplaces.
