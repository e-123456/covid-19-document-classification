However, manifestations in other organs should not be ignored since they can also be a mode of transmission. We sought to describe the ocular manifestations of COVID-19 and investigate the association between ocular involvement and clinical presentation and laboratory outcomes. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. Ninety-three sequentially hospitalized and clinically confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in the study. The systemic and ocular symptoms, clinical findings, and laboratory outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 93 COVID-19 patients, 54 (58.1%) were male, and 39 (41.9%) were female. Mean age of the patients was 39.4 +/- 21.9 (min 7, max 88) years. Twenty patients (n 21.5%) had at least one ocular abnormality. Most common findings included hyperemia (n = 20), epiphora (n = 9), increased secretion (n = 6), chemosis (n = 3), follicular conjunctivitis (n = 2), and episcleritis (n = 2). The most common symptom was photophobia (n 15). Patients with ocular involvement were more likely to have higher neutrophil counts (p = 0.001), and increased CRP (p < 0.001), PCT (p = 0.001), and ESR levels (p < 0.001). Mean lymphocyte count was statistically lower in patients with ocular manifestations (p = 0.001). Mean age and number of patients with fever over 37.3 degrees C in the ocular involvement group was found to be higher (p < 0.001, p = 0.006, respectively). CONCLUSION: Older age, high fever, increased neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and high levels of acute phase reactants seemed to be risk factors for ocular involvement.","Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol","Bostanci Ceran, Basak","Ozates, Serdar","32504100"],"abstract":["PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing global public health problem, and most of the COVID-19 research is focused mainly on the respiratory system because of life-threatening results.
