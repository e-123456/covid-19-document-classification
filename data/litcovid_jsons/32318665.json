Results Among the 61 cases of children who died of viral pneumonia, most were within 2 years old 83.61%, and a large proportion died within 2 weeks after the onset of the disease 91.80%. General changes in postmortem examination included respiratory mucosal hyperemia, pleural effusion, pulmonary swelling, variegated pulmonary pleura and serosa, focal hemorrhage and edema of the cut surface of the lung. A large proportion of children had enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes 83.61%, and 21.31% of children had thymic dysplasia.
