The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of acetic acid, the active component of vinegar, as a potential disinfectant agent for upper airways. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients were enrolled and divided into two groups: group 1 (14 patients) was composed of patients treated with off-label hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, whereas group 2 (15 patients) was composed of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine only, combined with the inhalation of acetic acid disinfectant at a 0.34% concentration. A questionnaire-based evaluation of symptoms was performed after 15 days in both groups. RESULTS: It appears that the number of patients treated with acetic acid (group 2) that experienced improvement in individual symptoms was double that of the other group of patients (group 1), although numbers are too small for robust statistical analysis.

The main observation end points of the study was the negative conversion time of nucleic acid of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in pharyngeal swab. Results: The baseline of 4 groups before treatment was consistent and comparable.

Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to a 14-day combination of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h, ribavirin 400 mg every 12 h, and three doses of 8 million international units of interferon beta-1b on alternate days (combination group) or to 14 days of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h (control group).
