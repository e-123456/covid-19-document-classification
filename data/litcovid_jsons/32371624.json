Second, suggested procedures regarding design of an inpatient rehabilitation unit for COVID-19 survivors, staffing issues, and considerations for outpatient rehabilitation have been made. Third, guidelines for rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology) following COVID-19 have been made, with respect to recovery of the respiratory system as well as mobility and function. A thorough assessment and individualized, progressive treatment plan which focuses on function, disability, and return to participation in society will help each patient to maximize their function and quality of life.
