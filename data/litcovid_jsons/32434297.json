We determine whether differences exist in cumulative incidence and mortality of Covid-19 infection between cancer patients and general population in Madrid. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed 1069 medical records of all cancer patients admitted at Oncology department between Feb 1 and April 7, 2020. We described Covid-19 cumulative incidence, treatment outcome, mortality, and associated risk factors. RESULTS: We detected 45/1069 Covid-19 diagnoses in cancer patients vs 42,450/6,662,000 in total population (p < 0.00001). Mortality rate: 19/45 cancer patients vs 5586/42,450 (p = 0.0001). Mortality was associated with older median age, adjusted by staging and histology (74 vs 63.5 years old, OR 1.06, p = 0.03). Patients who combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin presented 3/18 deaths, regardless of age, staging, histology, cancer treatment and comorbidities (OR 0.02, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Cancer patients are vulnerable to Covid-19 with an increase in complications. Combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin is presented as a good treatment option.","Clin Transl Oncol","Rogado, J","Obispo, B","Pangua, C","Serrano-Montero, G","Martin Marino, A","Perez-Perez, M","Lopez-Alfonso, A","Gullon, P","Lara, M A","32449128"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: There are no large reported series determining the Covid-19 cancer patient's characteristics.
