African countries now face difficult choices regarding easing of lockdowns and sustaining effective public health control measures and surveillance. Control of the COVID-19 pandemic will require efficient community screening, testing, contact tracing, and behavioral change interventions, adequate resources, and a well-supported, community-based team of trained, protected personnel. We discuss COVID-19 screening-testing-contact tracing approaches used in selected African countries and the need for shared, affordable, innovative methods to overcome challenges and minimize mortality rates. This crisis presents a unique opportunity to align COVID-19 services with those already in place for HIV, TB, Malaria, and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) through mobilization of Africa's inter-professional healthcare workforce to contain the pandemic.
