This study aimed to identify potential risk factors for mortality in older patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on admission, which may help identify those with poor prognosis at an early stage. DESIGN: Retrospective case-control. SETTING: Fever ward of Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Patients >/=60 years of age with COVID-19 (n = 244) were included, of which 123 were discharged and 121 died in hospital. MEASUREMENTS: Data retrieved from electronic medical records regarding symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings on admission, and final outcomes of all older patients with COVID-19, were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore risk factors for death. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that several clinical characteristics and laboratory variables were significantly different (i.e., p < .05) between discharged and deceased patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that lymphocyte (LYM) count (odds ratio [OR] 0.009 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.001-0.138]; p = .001) and older age (OR 1.1 22 [95% CI 1.007-1.249]; p = .037) were independently associated with hospital mortality. White blood cell count was also an important risk factor (p = .052). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the logistic regression model was 0.913. Risk factors for in-hospital death were similar between older men and women. CONCLUSION: Older age and lower LYM count on admission were associated with death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (>/=18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020.

Multivariable Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank test were used to explore risk factors related to in-hospital death and in-hospital adverse outcomes. Results: Of 703 patients, 55 (8%) developed adverse outcomes (including 33 deceased), 648 (92%) discharged without any adverse outcome. Multivariable regression analysis showed risk factors associated with in-hospital death included >/= 2 comorbidities (hazard ratio [HR], 6.734; 95% CI; 3.239-14.003, p < 0.001), leukocytosis (HR, 9.639; 95% CI, 4.572-20.321, p < 0.001), lymphopenia (HR, 4.579; 95% CI, 1.334-15.715, p = 0.016) and CT severity score > 14 (HR, 2.915; 95% CI, 1.376-6.177, p = 0.005) on admission, while older age (HR, 2.231; 95% CI, 1.124-4.427, p = 0.022), >/= 2 comorbidities (HR, 4.778; 95% CI; 2.451-9.315, p < 0.001), leukocytosis (HR, 6.349; 95% CI; 3.330-12.108, p < 0.001), lymphopenia (HR, 3.014; 95% CI; 1.356-6.697, p = 0.007) and CT severity score > 14 (HR, 1.946; 95% CI; 1.095-3.459, p = 0.023) were associated with increased odds of composite adverse outcomes. Conclusion: The risk factors of older age, multiple comorbidities, leukocytosis, lymphopenia and higher CT severity score could help clinicians identify patients with potential adverse events."],"journal":"Theranostics","authors":["Xu, Peng Peng","Tian, Rong Hua","Luo, Song","Zu, Zi Yue","Fan, Bin","Wang, Xi Ming","Xu, Kai","Wang, Jiang Tao","Zhu, Juan","Shi, Ji Chan","Chen, Feng","Wan, Bing","Yan, Zhi Han","Wang, Rong Pin","Chen, Wen","Fan, Wen Hui","Zhang, Can","Lu, Meng Jie","Sun, Zhi Yuan","Zhou, Chang Sheng","Zhang, Li Na","Xia, Fei","Qi, Li","Zhang, Wei","Zhong, Jing","Liu, Xiao Xue","Zhang, Qi Rui","Lu, Guang Ming","Zhang, Long Jiang"],"date":"2020-06-03T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32483458","source":"PubMed","week":"202023|Jun 01 - Jun 07","doi":"10.7150/thno.46833","keywords":["covid-19","coronavirus","mortality","pneumonia","risk factor"],"locations":["China","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Treatment","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1668532114890424320,"score":245.67076}]}
