DESIGN: Prospective, descriptive study. METHOD: The registry focused on atypical symptoms and co-infections. We hypothesized that patients older than 70 years more often have atypical symptoms. The number of co-infections is unknown. Therefore, we prospectively registered medical history, duration of symptoms, symptoms, temperature, lab results and co-infections of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the period March 4-16th. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of 107 patients were registered. The average age was 71 years and 41% was female. The median duration of symptoms was 5 days. 19% of patients had not been referred to pulmonary or internal medicine. Symptoms were fever (78%), respiratory complaints (78%), chest pain (28%), abdominal pain (13%), and diarrhea (34%). In 54% of the COVID-19 patients at the ED, the temperature was >/= 38,0 degrees C, CRP >/= 50 in 51%, leucocytosis in 12% and elevated LD in 61%. Of 31 patients 24 (77%) had an absolute lymphopenia. Co-infections were seen in 16% of patients. The mortality in the ED was 2% and ICU-admission 5%. On March 25th, 2020 the overall mortality was 22% and ICU-admission 15%. CONCLUSION: We have seen patients with a very serious disease resulting in a high mortality and ICU-admission. Over 35% of patient did not have the typical symptoms of fever and respiratory complaints; atypical symptoms like chest pain, abdominal pain and diarrhea are frequently seen. There is no difference between patients over and under 70 years. COVID-19 patients can present with atypical symptoms, co-infections and distributed over various medical specialties.","Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd","Buenen, A G","Wever, P C","Borst, D P","Slieker, K A","32392009"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To describe disease presentation and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) of Bernhoven hospital in Uden, the Netherlands.

In this study, we aimed to further investigate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms. METHODS: In this descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study, we enrolled confirmed patients with COVID-19 who presented to 3 hospitals from January 18, 2020, to February 28, 2020. All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment. Data were followed up until March 18, 2020. RESULTS: In the present study, 204 patients with COVID-19 and full laboratory, imaging, and historical data were analyzed. The average age was 52.9 years (SD +/- 16), including 107 men and 97 women. Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases). If lack of appetite is excluded from the analysis (because it is less specific for the gastrointestinal tract), there were 38 total cases (18.6%) where patients presented with a gastrointestinal-specific symptom, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days). In 6 cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms. As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced. Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms. DISCUSSION: We found that digestive symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, these patients have a longer time from onset to admission, evidence of longer coagulation, and higher liver enzyme levels. Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, are commonly among the presenting features of COVID-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms.
