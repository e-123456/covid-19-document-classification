In aesthetic clinics, most procedures are provided on one to one basis by the physician or therapist. In such a scenario, guidelines detailing the infection control measures for aesthetic clinics are of particular importance. METHODS: An online meeting of an international group of experts in the field of aesthetic medicine, with experience in administration of an aesthetic clinic, was convened. The meeting aimed to provide a set of consensus guidelines to protect clinic staff and patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Consensus guidelines for 'preferred practices' were provided for scheduling of patients, patient evaluation and triaging, and for safety precautions about the different procedures. Procedures were categorized into low-risk, moderate risk, and high-risk based on the likelihood of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus from the patient to the treating physician or therapist. CONCLUSIONS: While not intended to be complete or exhaustive, these guidelines provide sound infection control measures for aesthetic practices.

Patients should be categorized based upon the priority as acute (require immediate treatment/surgery within 24 h), sub-acute (requiring treatment within a maximum of 7-10 days), or chronic (requiring treatment within a month).
