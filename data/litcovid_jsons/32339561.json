METHODS: Urologic trainees and attending physicians at our institution, who are familiar with existing safety recommendations and guidelines regarding the care of infected patients, were queried regarding their experiences to determine an expert consensus on best practices for bedside procedures for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. RESULTS: Our team developed the following general recommendations for urologic interventions on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients: maximize use of telehealth (even for inpatient consults), minimize in-room time, use personal protective equipment appropriately, enlist a colleague to assist, and acquire all supplies that may be needed and maintain them outside the room. Detailed recommendations were also developed for difficult urethral catheterization, bedside cystoscopy, incision and drainage of abscesses, and gross hematuria/clot irrigations. CONCLUSIONS: As patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection are predominantly men over 50 years old, there are significant urologic challenges common in this population that have emerged with this pandemic. While there is tremendous variation in how different regions have been affected, the demographics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that urologists will continue to have a unique role in helping to manage these patients. Here, we summarize recommendations for bedside urologic interventions specific to SARS-CoV-2 positive patients based on experiences from a large metropolitan hospital system. Regulations and requirements may differ on an institutional basis, so these guidelines are intended to augment specific local protocols.","Urology","Souders, Colby P","Zhao, Hanson","Ackerman, A Lenore","32339561"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To provide guidance when performing bedside urologic procedures on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and offer considerations to maximize the safety of the patients and providers, conserve supplies, and provide optimal management of urologic issues.

This pathway seeks to outline a urology patient care strategy that reduces the transmission risk to both healthcare providers and patients, reduces the healthcare burden, and maintains appropriate patient care. METHODS: Consultations to the urology service during a three-week period (March 16 to April 2, 2020) were triaged and managed via one of three pathways: Standard, Telemedicine, or High-Risk. Standard consults were in-person consults with non- COVID-19 patients, High-Risk consults were in-person consults with COVID-19 positive/suspected patients, and Telemedicine consults were telephonic consults for low-acuity urologic issues in either group of patients. Patient demographics, consultation parameters and consultation outcomes were compared to consultations from the month of March 2019. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square test and continuous variables using Mann-Whitney U test. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Between March 16 and April 2, 2020, 53 inpatient consultations were performed. By following our triage pathway, a total of 19/53 consultations (35.8%) were performed via Telemedicine with no in-person exposure, 10/53 consultations (18.9%) were High-Risk, in which we strictly controlled the urology team member in-person contact, and the remainder, 24/53 consultations (45.2%), were performed as Standard in-person encounters. COVID-19 associated consultations represented 18/53 (34.0%) of all consultations during this period, and of these, 8/18 (44.4%) were managed successfully via Telemedicine alone.
