The relation between obesity and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not been fully documented. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study we analyzed the relationship between clinical characteristics, including body mass index (BMI), and the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in 124 consecutive patients admitted in intensive care for SARS-CoV-2, in a single French center. RESULTS: Obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) and severe obesity (BMI >35 kg/m2) were present in 47.6% and 28.2% of cases, respectively. Overall, 85 patients (68.6%) required IMV. The proportion of patients who required IMV increased with BMI categories (p<0.01, Chi square test for trend), and it was greatest in patients with BMI >35 kg/m2 (85.7%). In multivariate logistic regression, the need for IMV was significantly associated with male sex (p<0.05) and BMI (p<0.05), independent of age, diabetes, and hypertension.
