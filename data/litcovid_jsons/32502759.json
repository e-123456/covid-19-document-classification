Intubation time with no aerosol box was significantly shorter than with the early-generation box ((median (IQR [range])) 42.9 (32.9-46.9 [30.9-57.6]) seconds vs. 82.1(45.1-98.3 [30.8-180.0]) seconds, p=0.002) and the latest-generation box (52.4(43.1-70.3 [35.7-169.2]) seconds, p=0.008). No intubations without a box took more than one minute, whereas 14 (58%) intubations with a box took over one minute and 4 (17%) took over two minutes (including one failure).

A particle generator was used to test the efficacy of the reduction of aerosolized particles by measuring their concentration within the enclosure and in the environment. No reductionin the concentration of aerosolized particles was noted with the enclosure flap open, whether the interior suction was on or off.

The concentration decreased even further, to 0.8% of baseline with the enclosure closed with augmented airflow (suction on).
