RESULTS: All children had positive epidemiologic histories, 12 (12/16, 75 %) involving family units. The illnesses were either mild (5/16, 31.3 %) or ordinary (11/16, 68.8 %), presenting as follows: asymptomatic (8/16, 50 %), fever and/or cough (8/16, 50 %). Four asymptomatic patients (4/16, 25 %) in ordinary cases had chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities.
