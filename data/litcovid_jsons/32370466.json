There was no difference between the two groups of patients for CD4 T-lymphocytes, neither in percentage of lymphocyte nor in absolute number, however for CD8 T-cells the differences were significant for both parameters which were in decline in ICU patients. There was a firm correlation between the highest values of inflammation indicators with the decrease in percentage of CD8 T-lymphocytes. This effect was not seen with CD4 cells. Obesity together with lymphopenia, especially whether preferentially affects to CD8 T- lymphocytes, are factors that can predict a poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19."],"journal":"Clin Immunol","authors":["Urra, J M","Cabrera, C M","Porras, L","Rodenas, I"],"date":"2020-06-02T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32479985","source":"PubMed","week":"202023|Jun 01 - Jun 07","doi":"10.1016/j.clim.2020.108486","topics":["Treatment","Mechanism","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1668532089484476416,"score":358.71103}]}
