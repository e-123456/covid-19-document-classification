This study aims to stratify face shield needs when performing head and neck cancer surgery. METHODS: Fifteen patients underwent surgery between March 1, 2020 and April 9, 2020. Operative diagnosis and procedure; droplet count and distribution on face shields were documented. RESULTS: Forty-five surgical procedures were performed for neck nodal metastatic carcinoma of unknown origin (n = 3); carcinoma of tonsil (n = 2), tongue (n = 2), nasopharynx (n = 3), maxilla (n = 1), and laryngopharynx (n = 4). Droplet contamination was 57.8%, 59.5%, 8.0%, and 0% for operating, first and second assistant surgeons, and scrub nurse respectively. Droplet count was highest and most widespread during osteotomies. No droplet splash was noted for transoral robotic surgery. CONCLUSION: Face shield is not a mandatory adjunctive PPE for all head and neck surgical procedures and health care providers. Judicious use helps to conserve resources during such difficult times.","Head Neck","Chow, Velda Ling Yu","Chan, Jimmy Yu Wai","Ho, Valerie Wai Yee","Lee, George Chung Ching","Wong, Melody Man Kuen","Wong, Stanley Thian Sze","Gao, Wei","32342543"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE).
