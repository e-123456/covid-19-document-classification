Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients are generally at high-risk for COVID-19 infection and severe adverse outcomes.

Urgent guidance in the delivery of safe, quality head and neck oncologic care is needed.

Additionally, novel, COVID-19-specific multilevel risks to HNC patients, HCWs and institutions, and society include: use of immunosuppressive therapy, nosocomial COVID-19 transmission, institutional COVID-19 outbreaks, and, at some locations, societal resource deficiencies requiring health care rationing.
