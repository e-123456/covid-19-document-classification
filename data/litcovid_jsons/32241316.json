The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China is striking.

Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years old accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]).
