Their gender, age, onset time were recorded. Take epidemiological history, fever, and the blood lymphocytes decline as clinical indicators, used CT to evaluate the possibility of COVID-19 and range of lung involvement. According to the current national standards, throat swabs of suspected cases were collected and the nucleic acid of COVID-19 was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The Xiangya process was constructed according to multi-index, compared with clinical indicators, CT results and national standards, the efficiency of detecting confirmed cases were verified in the test and verification library. Results: A continuous cohort of 382 adults who screened COVID-19 was included in which 261 cases were in the test library and 121 cases were in the verification library. In the 382 cases, 192 were males (50.3%) and 190 were females (49.7%), with a median age of 35 years (range: 15-92 years). There were 183 cases (47.9%) with epidemiological history, 275 cases (72.0%) with fever, 212 cases (55.5%) with decreased hemolytic lymphocytes, CT positive 114 cases (29.8%), 43 cases (11.3%) with positive CT-COVID-19, and 30 cases (7.9%) with positive throat swab nucleic acid. Compared with clinical indicators, the sensitivity and specificity of CT were 0.950 and 0.704, respectively. The accuracy of CT to make a definite diagnosis was higher than that of epidemiological history, fever, and blood lymph count decline (0.809 vs 0.660, 0.532, 0.596, P=0.001, 0.002, 0.003, respectively). The sensitivity of this process and the program recommended by the Health Commission all were high (all were 1.000) , and the specificity and accuracy of the process were higher than the program recommended by the Health Commission (0.872 vs 0.765, 0.778 vs 0.592, both P<0.001). The CT-COVID-19 would have reduced the missed diagnosis rate caused by false negative of nucleic acid test (31 vs 64, difference rate 51.6%), the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 64.5% (20/31).
