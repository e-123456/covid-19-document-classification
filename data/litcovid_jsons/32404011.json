Methods: A retrospective case analysis of effectiveness and safety of aliskiren treatment to lower blood pressure in three severe and one critically ill patients of COVID-19 with hypertension. Results: Four patients, two males and two females, with an average age of 78 years (66-87 years), were referred to hospital mainly because of respiratory symptoms. Three cases were confirmed by 2019-nCoV nucleic acid and antibody detection (severe type), and one with cardiac insufficiency was clinically determined (critically ill type). The previous diagnosis of hypertension was clear. Two patients took calcium channel antagonist (CCB), one patient took angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), and one patient took angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB). After admission, ACEI or ARB were discontinued, one patient with heart failure patient was treated by aliskiren combined with diuretic; 3 patients were treated with aliskiren combined with CCB. Two patients were stopped to use CCB due to low blood pressure after 1 to 2 weeks of using CCB and aliskiren. On the basis of comprehensive therapy combined with antiviral and oxygenation treatment, aliskiren antihypertensive treatment was taken for three to four weeks. The blood pressure control of four patients was satisfactory and there was no complaint of discomfort. The condition improved, and all patients had reached the discharge standard and were discharged. Conclusion: Our preliminary clinical data shows that aliskiren's antihypertensive therapy is effective and safe for severe COVID-19 patients complicated with hypertension. Further clinical aliskiren therapy study is required with more COVID-19 patients.."],"journal":"Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi","authors":["Guo, Y","Zeng, J","Li, Q","Li, P","Luo, F M","Zhang, W Z","Lu, Y X","Wang, Q","Zhang, W","Zeng, Z P","Liu, L S"],"date":"2020-04-29T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32340096","source":"PubMed","week":"202018|Apr 27 - May 03","doi":"10.3760/cma.j.cn112138-20200328-00310","keywords":["aliskiren","angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor","angiotensin receptor antagonist","covid-19","calcium channel antagonist","hypertension"],"e_drugs":["Calcium","aliskiren"],"topics":["Treatment","Mechanism"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138495024889859,"score":286.20157}]}
