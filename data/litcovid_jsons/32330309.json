METHODS: Electronical medical records, including demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiological findings, of enrolled patients were extracted and analyzed. Pharyngeal swab, stool and urine specimens were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. Viral shedding at multiple time points in specimens was recorded, and analyzed its correlation with clinical manifestations and the severity of illness. RESULTS: A total of 42 laboratory-confirmed patients were enrolled, 8 (19.05%) of whom had gastrointestinal symptoms. 28 (66.67%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens, which was not associated with the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the severity of illness.

These cases were compared with the 99 cases, previously published in Lancet, from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from January 1 to January 20, 2020.
