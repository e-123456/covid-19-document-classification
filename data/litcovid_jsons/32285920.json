Design: Multicentre retrospective observational cohort study. Setting: Three multidisciplinary intensive care units (ICUs) in Hong Kong. Participants: All adult critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICUs in Hong Kong between 22 January and 11 February 2020. Main outcome measure: 28-day mortality. Results: Eight out of 49 patients with COVID-19 (16%) were admitted to Hong Kong ICUs during the study period. The median age was 64.5 years (range, 42-70) with a median admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 6 (IQR, 4-7). Six patients (75%) required mechanical ventilation, six patients (75%) required vasopressors and two (25%) required renal replacement therapy. None of the patients required prone ventilation, nitric oxide or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The median times to shock reversal and extubation were 9 and 11 days respectively.
