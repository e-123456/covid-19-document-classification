Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were analyzed. The final date of follow-up was March 19, 2020. RESULTS: The median age of 101 patients was 62 years (interquartile range, 49-72). All patients were local residents of Wuhan. In terms of common symptoms, there were differences between patients on hemodialysis and controls (fatigue [59% versus 83%], dry cough [49% versus 71%], and fever [47% versus 90%]).

Comparing patients on hemodialysis with controls, creatine kinase-muscle and brain type, myoglobin, hypersensitive troponin I, B-type natriuretic peptide, and procalcitonin were increased, and the percentage of abnormalities in bilateral lung was higher in computed tomographic scan (82% versus 69%, P=0.15) and unilateral lung was lower (10% versus 27%, P=0.03). Common complications including shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia, and acute cardiac injury in patients on hemodialysis were significantly higher.
