Collaboration was obtained from physicians, nursing, radiation therapy, and administration to recall their policies and impact on specific duties. A timeline was reconstructed to chronicle significant events. Numbers were obtained for patients on treatment, treatments breaks, and COVID-19 infections amongst staff and patients. Results: The COVID-19 surge had a tremendous impact on the health system including cessation of all of surgeries, including oncologic surgery, as well as transfer of all inpatient oncology services to makeshift outpatient facilities. Radiation Oncology made aggressive efforts to reduce patients on treatment to protect patients and staff as well reallocate staff and space for more acute clinical needs.
