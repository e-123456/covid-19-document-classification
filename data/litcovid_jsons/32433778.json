Inhibition of the IL-6 pathway with tocilizumab has been employed successfully in some of these patients but the data is mostly consistent of case reports and series. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Medline from 22(nd) April 2020 and again on 27(th) April 2020 using the following search terms alone or in combination: \"COVID-19\", \"coronavirus\", \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"COVID\", \"anti-interleukin 6 receptor antibodies\", \"anti-IL-6\", \"tocilizumab\", \"sarilumab\", \"siltuximab\". We included studies which reported individual patient data. We extracted and analyzed individual level data on baseline characteristics, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes. Primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints included in-hospital complications, recovery rates, effect of patient characteristics on the primary outcome and changes in levels of inflammatory markers. RESULTS: 352 records were identified through the systematic search of which 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. A single study currently under review was also added. Eleven observational studies encompassing 29 patients were included in the present review. There were more males (24 [82.8%]) and hypertension was the most common comorbidity (16 [48.3 %]). Over an average of 5.4 hospital days, the primary endpoint occurred in 6 (20.7%) patients. Among surviving patients, about 10% had worsened disease and 17% recovered. The most common complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome (8[27.6%]). IL-6 level was significantly higher after the initiation of tocilizumab with median (IQR) of 376.6 (148-900.6) pg/mL compared to the baseline of 71.1 (31.9-122.8) pg/mL (p=0.002). Mean (SD) levels of c-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly decreased following treatment 24.6 (26.9) mg/L compared to baseline 140.4 (77) mg/L (P< 0.0001). Baseline demographics were not significantly different amongst survivors and non-survivors by Fisher's exact test. CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 patients treated with tocilizumab, IL-6 levels are significantly elevated which are supportive of cytokine storm. Following initiation of tocilizumab, there is elevation in the IL-6 levels and CRP levels dramatically decrease suggesting an improvement in this hyper-inflammatory state. Ongoing randomized control trials will allow for further evaluation of this promising therapy. IMPORTANCE: Recent data indicate that severe COVID 19 causes cytokine release storm and is associated with worse clinical outcomes and IL-6 plays an important role. It is suggestive that anti-IL6 results in the improvement of this hyperinflammatory state.
