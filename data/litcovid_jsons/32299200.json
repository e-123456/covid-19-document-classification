We aim to identify differences in CT imaging and clinical manifestations between pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19, and to develop and validate a diagnostic model for COVID-19 based on radiological semantic and clinical features alone. METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 70 COVID-19 and 66 non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients were retrospectively recruited from five institutions. Patients were divided into primary (n = 98) and validation (n = 38) cohorts. The chi-square test, Student's t test, and Kruskal-Wallis H test were performed, comparing 1745 lesions and 67 features in the two groups. Three models were constructed using radiological semantic and clinical features through multivariate logistic regression.

RESULTS: Eighteen radiological semantic features and seventeen clinical features were identified to be significantly different. Besides ground-glass opacities (p = 0.032) and consolidation (p = 0.001) in the lung periphery, the lesion size (1-3 cm) is also significant for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (p = 0.027).
