Two thoracic radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT signs of the lesions and also scored the extent of involvement of the CT signs. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare lesion distribution and CT scores. The chi-square test was used to compare the CT signs of early-phase versus advanced-phase COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS. A total of 62 patients (39 men and 23 women; mean [+/- SD] age, 52.8 +/- 12.2 years; range, 30-77 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Twenty-four of 30 patients who underwent routine blood tests (80.0%) had a decreased lymphocyte count. Of 27 patients who had their erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level assessed, 18 (66.7%) had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and all 27 (100.0%) had an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. Multiple lesions were seen on the initial CT scan of 52 of 62 patients (83.9%). Forty-eight of 62 patients (77.4%) had predominantly peripheral distribution of lesions.

The mean CT score for the anterior area (4.4 +/- 4.1) was significantly lower than that for the posterior area (7.7 +/- 6.3) (p = 0.003).

With regard to bronchial changes seen on CT, 45 patients (72.6%) had air bronchogram, and 11 (17.7%) had bronchus distortion. In terms of pleural changes, CT showed that 30 patients (48.4%) had pleural thickening, 35 (56.5%) had pleural retraction sign, and six (9.7%) had pleural effusion. Compared with early-phase disease (</= 7 days after the onset of symptoms), advanced-phase disease (8-14 days after the onset of symptoms) was characterized by significantly increased frequencies of GGO plus a reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, fibrotic streaks, a subpleural line, a subpleural transparent line, air bronchogram, bronchus distortion, and pleural effusion; however, GGO significantly decreased in advanced-phase disease.

The clinical manifestations were fever in 94 of 108 (87%) patients, dry cough in 65 (60%), and fatigue in 42 (39%). The laboratory results were normal WBC count in 97 (90%) patients and normal or reduced lymphocyte count in 65 (60%). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein level was elevated in 107 (99%) patients. The distribution of involved lobes was one lobe in 38 (35%) patients, two or three lobes in 24 (22%), and four or five lobes in 46 (43%). The major involvement was peripheral (97 patients [90%]), and the common lesion shape was patchy (93 patients [86%]). Sixty-five (60%) patients had ground-glass opacity (GGO), and 44 (41%) had GGO with consolidation. The size of lesions varied from smaller than 1 cm (10 patients [9%]) to larger than 3 cm (56 patients [52%]).

The purpose of this study was to investigate early clinical and CT manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) were enrolled in this retrospective study. The clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and CT findings were evaluated. RESULTS. One hundred eight patients (38 men, 70 women; age range, 21-90 years) were included in the study. The clinical manifestations were fever in 94 of 108 (87%) patients, dry cough in 65 (60%), and fatigue in 42 (39%). The laboratory results were normal WBC count in 97 (90%) patients and normal or reduced lymphocyte count in 65 (60%). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein level was elevated in 107 (99%) patients. The distribution of involved lobes was one lobe in 38 (35%) patients, two or three lobes in 24 (22%), and four or five lobes in 46 (43%). The major involvement was peripheral (97 patients [90%]), and the common lesion shape was patchy (93 patients [86%]). Sixty-five (60%) patients had ground-glass opacity (GGO), and 44 (41%) had GGO with consolidation. The size of lesions varied from smaller than 1 cm (10 patients [9%]) to larger than 3 cm (56 patients [52%]). Vascular thickening (86 patients [80%]), crazy paving pattern (43 patients [40%]), air bronchogram sign (52 patients [48%]), and halo sign (69 [64%]) were also observed in this study. CONCLUSION. The early clinical and laboratory findings of COVID-19 pneumonia are low to midgrade fever, dry cough, and fatigue with normal WBC count, reduced lymphocyte count, and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level.
