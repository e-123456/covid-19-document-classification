Results: The age of the 31 children with 2019-nCoV infection was 7 years and 1 month (6 months -17 years). Nine cases (29%) were imported cases. Other 21 cases (68%) had contact with confirmed infected adults. One case (3%) had contact with asymptomatic returnees from Wuhan. Among the 31 children, 28 patients (90%) were family cluster cases.

Despite the rapidly increasing number of cases in subsequent weeks, the clinical characteristics of pediatric cases are rarely described. A cross-sectional multicenter study was carried out in 10 hospitals across Hubei province. A total of 25 confirmed pediatric cases of COVID-19 were collected. The demographic data, epidemiological history, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological data, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. Of 25 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the boy to girl ratio was 1.27:1. The median age was 3 years. COVID-19 cases in children aged <3 years, 3.6 years, and >/=6-years patients were 10 (40%), 6 (24%), and 9 (36%), respectively. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (13 [52%]), and dry cough (11 [44%]). Chest CT images showed essential normal in 8 cases (33.3%), unilateral involvement of lungs in 5 cases (20.8%), and bilateral involvement in 11 cases (45.8%). Clinical diagnoses included upper respiratory tract infection (n=8), mild pneumonia (n=15), and critical cases (n=2). Two critical cases (8%) were given invasive mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, and immunoglobulin. The symptoms in 24 (96%) of 25 patients were alleviated and one patient had been discharged. It was concluded that children were susceptible to COVID-19 like adults, while the clinical presentations and outcomes were more favorable in children. However, children less than 3 years old accounted for majority cases and critical cases lied in this age group, which demanded extra attentions during home caring and hospitalization treatment.","Curr Med Sci","Zheng, Fang","Liao, Chun","Fan, Qi-Hong","Chen, Hong-Bo","Zhao, Xue-Gong","Xie, Zhong-Guo","Li, Xi-Lin","Chen, Chun-Xi","Lu, Xiao-Xia","Liu, Zhi-Sheng","Lu, Wei","Chen, Chun-Bao","Jiao, Rong","Zhang, Ai-Ming","Wang, Jin-Tang","Ding, Xi-Wei","Zeng, Yao-Guang","Cheng, Li-Ping","Huang, Qing-Feng","Wu, Jiang","Luo, Xi-Chang","Wang, Zhu-Jun","Zhong, Yan-Yan","Bai, Yan","Wu, Xiao-Yan","Jin, Run-Ming","32207032"],"abstract":["Since December 2019, COVID-19 has occurred unexpectedly and emerged as a health problem worldwide. Despite the rapidly increasing number of cases in subsequent weeks, the clinical characteristics of pediatric cases are rarely described. A cross-sectional multicenter study was carried out in 10 hospitals across Hubei province. A total of 25 confirmed pediatric cases of COVID-19 were collected. The demographic data, epidemiological history, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological data, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. Of 25 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the boy to girl ratio was 1.27:1. The median age was 3 years. COVID-19 cases in children aged <3 years, 3.6 years, and >/=6-years patients were 10 (40%), 6 (24%), and 9 (36%), respectively. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (13 [52%]), and dry cough (11 [44%]). Chest CT images showed essential normal in 8 cases (33.3%), unilateral involvement of lungs in 5 cases (20.8%), and bilateral involvement in 11 cases (45.8%). Clinical diagnoses included upper respiratory tract infection (n=8), mild pneumonia (n=15), and critical cases (n=2). Two critical cases (8%) were given invasive mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, and immunoglobulin. The symptoms in 24 (96%) of 25 patients were alleviated and one patient had been discharged. It was concluded that children were susceptible to COVID-19 like adults, while the clinical presentations and outcomes were more favorable in children. However, children less than 3 years old accounted for majority cases and critical cases lied in this age group, which demanded extra attentions during home caring and hospitalization treatment."],"journal":"Curr Med Sci","authors":["Zheng, Fang","Liao, Chun","Fan, Qi-Hong","Chen, Hong-Bo","Zhao, Xue-Gong","Xie, Zhong-Guo","Li, Xi-Lin","Chen, Chun-Xi","Lu, Xiao-Xia","Liu, Zhi-Sheng","Lu, Wei","Chen, Chun-Bao","Jiao, Rong","Zhang, Ai-Ming","Wang, Jin-Tang","Ding, Xi-Wei","Zeng, Yao-Guang","Cheng, Li-Ping","Huang, Qing-Feng","Wu, Jiang","Luo, Xi-Chang","Wang, Zhu-Jun","Zhong, Yan-Yan","Bai, Yan","Wu, Xiao-Yan","Jin, Run-Ming"],"date":"2020-03-25T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32207032","week":"202013|Mar 23 - Mar 29","doi":"10.1007/s11596-020-2172-6","keywords":["COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2","children","coronavirus"],"source":"PubMed","locations":["China","Hubei"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1663352133717590016,"score":234.96962}]}
