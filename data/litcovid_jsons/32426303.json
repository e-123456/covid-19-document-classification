MATERIAL AND METHODS: Oncological PET studies carried out in asymptomatic patients between March 18 and April 8, 2020 have been reviewed. Patients who presented findings suggestive of corresponding to an pulmonary infectious process were selected. Clinical findings have been reviewed to confirm or rule out SARS-CoV2 infection. RESULTS: During the specified period, a total of 129 PET-CT studies were performed. Of these, 11 (8.5%) found suspicious findings of a pulmonary infectious process. These were 8 men and 3 women aged between 30 and 79 years (mean 62.2). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID 19 can present few symptoms of the disease, and in PET-CT studies both presymptomatic and almost asymptomatic patients can be detected, so nuclear medicine physicians should take special attention to the pulmonary evaluation of PET-CT studies.","Rev Esp Med Nucl Imagen Mol","Rasilla, Jorge Mucientes","Pernett, Rafael Jimeno","Arbonies, Jorge Cardona","32426303"],"abstract":["INTRODUCTION: On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international emergency due to the pandemic caused by a new coronavirus.

We reviewed the scans, collected medical history, and exposure information. RESULTS: Among the 13 scans, we identified 5 cases with imaging findings suspicious for viral infection.
