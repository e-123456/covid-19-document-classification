Task force members voted on agreement with draft statements using a 9-point numeric scoring system (1 to 9), and consensus was determined to be \"low\", \"moderate\", or \"high\", based on the dispersion of votes. For approval, median votes were required to meet pre-defined levels of agreement (median values of 7-9, 4-6, and 1-3 defined as \"agreement\", \"uncertainty\" or \"disagreement\", respectively) with either moderate or high levels of consensus. RESULTS: The task force approved 77 initial guidance statements, 36 with moderate and 41 with high consensus. These were combined, resulting in 25 final guidance statements.

The French Society of Rheumatology (SFR) selected the most critical ones to the daily practice of a rheumatologist and a group of 10 experts from SFR and Club Rheumatism and Inflammation (CRI) boards proposed responses based on the current knowledge of May 2020. BASIC PROCEDURE: Following the availability of the first 18 questions and statements, 1400 individuals consulted the frequently asked questions between the March 31, 2020 and April 12, 2020. As a result, 16 additional questions were forwarded to the SFR, and answered by the board. An additional round of review by email and video conference was organized, which included updates of the previous statements. The scientific relevance of 5 of the questions led to their inclusion in this document.

MAIN FINDINGS: Based on current scientific literature already published, in most circumstances, there is no contraindication to the initiation or continuation of anti-inflammatory drugs as well as DMARDs. If signs suggestive of infection (coronavirus or other) occurs, treatments should be discontinued and resumed, if necessary, after 2 weeks without any symptoms.
