Depending on the extent of the outbreak, there may be insufficient capacity to provide ventilator support to all of those in need. As part of a larger conceptual framework for determining need for and allocation of ventilators during a public health emergency, this article focuses on the strategies to assist state and local planners to allocate stockpiled ventilators to healthcare facilities during a pandemic, accounting for critical factors in facilities' ability to make use of additional ventilators. These strategies include actions both in the pre-pandemic and intra-pandemic stages. As a part of pandemic preparedness, public health officials should identify and query healthcare facilities in their jurisdiction that currently care for critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation to determine existing inventory of these devices and facilities' ability to absorb additional ventilators. Facilities must have sufficient staff, space, equipment, and supplies to utilize allocated ventilators adequately. At the time of an event, jurisdictions will need to verify and update information on facilities' capacity prior to making allocation decisions. Allocation of scarce life-saving resources during a pandemic should consider ethical principles to inform state and local plans for allocation of ventilators. In addition to ethical principles, decisions should be informed by assessment of need, determination of facilities' ability to use additional ventilators, and facilities' capacity to ensure access to ventilators for vulnerable populations (eg, rural, inner city, and uninsured and underinsured individuals) or high-risk populations that may be more susceptible to illness.","Health Secur","Koonin, Lisa M","Pillai, Satish","Kahn, Emily B","Moulia, Danielle","Patel, Anita","32196387"],"abstract":["During a severe pandemic, especially one causing respiratory illness, many people may require mechanical ventilation.

Methods: Using Baidu Index Platform (http://index.baidu.com) and the website of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention as data resources to obtain the search volume (SV) of keywords for symptoms associated with COVID-19 from January 1 to February 20 in each year from 2017 to 2020, in Hubei province and other top 10 impacted provinces in China and the epidemic data. Data of 2020 were compared with the previous three years. Data of Hubei province were compared with confirmed cases. The differences and characteristics of the SV of COVID-19-related symptoms, and the correlation between the SV of COVID-19 and new confirmed or suspected cases were analyzed and the hysteresis effects were discussed. Results: Compared the data from January 1 to February 20, 2020, with the SV for the same period of previous three years, Hubei's SV for cough, fever, diarrhea, chest tightness, dyspnea and other symptoms were significantly increased. The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms was significantly higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms (P<0.001). The SV of COVID-19 in Hubei province was significantly correlated with new confirmed or suspected cases (R(confirmed) = 0.723, R(suspected) = 0.863, all P < 0.001). The results of the distributed lag model suggested that the patients who retrieved relevant symptoms on the Internet may begin to see a doctor in 2-3 days later and be diagnosed in 3-4 days later. Conclusions: The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms is higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms, and the SV of diarrhea also increased significantly.
