Furthermore, patients with pre-existing cardiac disease are likely to experience a more severe disease course with COVID-19. As case numbers continue to increase exponentially, a surge in the number of patients with new or comorbid cardiovascular disease will translate into more frequent, and in some cases, prolonged rehabilitation needs following acute hospitalization.
