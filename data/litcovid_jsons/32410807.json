However, corticosteroid treatment was associated with higher mortality (RR=2.11, 95%CI=1.13-3.94, P=0.019), longer length of stay (weighted mean difference [WMD]=6.31, 95%CI=5.26-7.37, P<0.001), a higher rate of bacterial infection (RR=2.08, 95%CI=1.54-2.81, P<0.001), and hypokalemia (RR=2.21, 95%CI=1.07-4.55, P=0.032) but not hyperglycemia (RR=1.37, 95%CI=0.68-2.76, P = 0.376) or hypocalcemia (RR=1.35, 95%CI=0.77-2.37, P=0.302). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe conditions are more likely to require corticosteroids. Corticosteroid use is associated with increased mortality in patients with coronavirus pneumonia."],"journal":"J Infect","authors":["Yang, Zhenwei","Liu, Jialong","Zhou, Yunjiao","Zhao, Xixian","Zhao, Qiu","Liu, Jing"],"date":"2020-04-14T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32283144","source":"PubMed","week":"202016|Apr 13 - Apr 19","doi":"10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.062","keywords":["covid-19","coronavirus","meta-analysis","corticosteroid treatment"],"locations":["Cochrane"],"countries":["Canada"],"countries_codes":["CAN|Canada"],"topics":["Treatment","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138491550957568,"score":387.01492}]}
