The novel Coronavirus caused a pandemic search for information with broad dissemination of false or misleading health information. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality and readability of online information about Wuhan Coronavirus (actually COVID-19), which was a trending topic in the net, using validated instruments and relate the quality of information to its readability. METHODS: The search was based on the term Wuhan Coronavirus on the Google website (6 February 2020). At the search time, the terms \"COVID-19\" or \"SARS-CoV-2\" did not exist yet. Critical analysis was performed on the first 110 hits using HON code, JAMA benchmark, DISCERN instrument, and Google rank. RESULTS: The Google search returned 309,000,000 hits. The first 110 websites were critically analyzed, and only 1.81% of the websites had the HON code seal. The JAMA benchmark showed that 39% of websites did not have any of the categories required by this tool and only 10% of the websites had the 4 quality criteria required by JAMA. The DISCERN score showed that 70% of the websites were evaluated as low score and none one was rated as high score. CONCLUSIONS: Non-health personnel and the scientific community need to be aware of the quality of the information they read and produce respectively.

METHODS: On February 29, 2020, we performed a Google search with the terms \"Prevention coronavirus,\" \"Prevention COVID-19,\" \"Prevencion coronavirus,\" and \"Prevencion COVID-19\". A univariate analysis was performed to study the association between the type of authorship, country of publication, and recommendations to avoid COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization (WHO). RESULTS: In total, 80 weblinks were reviewed. Most of them were produced in the United States and Spain (n=58, 73%) by digital media sources and official public health organizations (n=60, 75%). The most mentioned WHO preventive measure was \"wash your hands frequently\" (n=65, 81%). A less frequent recommendation was to \"stay home if you feel unwell\" (n=26, 33%). The analysis by type of author (official public health organizations versus digital media) revealed significant differences regarding the recommendation to wear a mask when you are healthy only if caring for a person with suspected COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 4.39).
