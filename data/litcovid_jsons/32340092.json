In clinical treatment, it is necessary to enhance clinical staff's awareness of law-based reporting, capabilities of syndromic surveillance, the use of infectious diseases reporting systems, and to improve national or local monitoring platforms for emerging infectious diseases detection. In terms of disease control, it is important to provide authorities to disease control departments through laws and regulations, improve the quantity and quality of related human resources, and strengthen the applied research and technical readiness targeted infections disease prevention, control and emergency preparedness. As for scientific research in major epidemic response, it is essential to strengthen research projects guided by national requests, build research institutions that can \"make a final decision\", establish national and regional key laboratories, and strengthen strategic technical reserve for emergency disease control and treatment.","Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi","Li, L M","Zhan, S Y","Chi, H","Deng, Y","Wang, L","Wang, B","32340092"],"abstract":["Based on systematic review of the role of clinical treatment, disease control and scientific research, and combining with the problems exposed by the COVID-19 epidemic, suggestions were proposed to reform and improve the prevention and treatment system for major epidemics diseases in China.
