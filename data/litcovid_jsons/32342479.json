All patients with confirmed Corona Virus Disease 2019 were enrolled, and their clinical data were gathered by reviewing electronic medical records. Outcomes of severely ill patients and non-severely ill patients were compared. RESULTS: Of 145 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the average age was 47.5 years old (standard deviation, 14.6) and 54.5% were men. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (15.2%), followed by diabetes mellitus (9.7%).

The median length of hospitalization was 17 (14-19) days, and the median time taken for positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results to become negative in recovered patients was 8 (6-10) days. INTERPRETATION: Mobile cabin hospitals provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms, and provide an effective isolation area to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2."],"journal":"Chest","authors":["Xiong, Zhongwei","Xin, Can","Yan, Md Xixi","Cai, Yuankun","Zhou, Keyao","Xie, Chuanshun","Zhang, Tingbao","Wu, Xiaohui","Liu, Kui","Li, Zhiqiang","Wang, Wei","Chen, Jincao"],"date":"2020-05-22T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32437696","source":"PubMed","week":"202021|May 18 - May 24","doi":"10.1016/j.chest.2020.05.515","keywords":["covid-19","sars-cov-2","clinical characteristics","mobile cabin hospital","outcomes"],"locations":["Wuhan","China","Wuhan"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Treatment","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1667521393599709184,"score":196.73965}]}
