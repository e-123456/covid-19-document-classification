Methods: We searched 7 data sources for eligible traditional medicine guidelines up to March 6, 2020 and found a total of 28 traditional medicine guidelines that provide treatment measures for COVID-19. Results: Of the 28 guidelines, there were 26 government-issued Chinese guidelines and 2 Korean guidelines.
