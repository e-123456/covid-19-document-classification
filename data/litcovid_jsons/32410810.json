STUDY DESIGN: We describe our approach to surge-in-place at a children's hospital to meet the local demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of re-deploying pediatric providers to work with internist-led teams throughout a medical center, pediatric physicians and nurses organized and staffed a 40-bed adult COVID-19 treatment unit within a children's hospital. We adapted internal medicine protocols, developed screening criteria to select appropriate patients for admission, and reorganized staffing and equipment to accommodate adult COVID-19 patients. We used patient counts and descriptive statistics to report sociodemographic, system, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The median patient age was 46 years; 69% were male. On admission, 78 (78%) required oxygen supplementation. During hospitalization, 13 (13%) eventually were intubated.
