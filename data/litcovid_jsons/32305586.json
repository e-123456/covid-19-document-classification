Reports of thromboembolic complications are scarce but suggestive for a clinical relevance of the problem. OBJECTIVES: Prospective observational study aimed to characterize the coagulation profile of COVID-19 ARDS patients with standard and viscoelastic coagulation tests, and to evaluate their changes after establishment of an aggressive thromboprophylaxis. METHODS: Sixteen patients with COVID-19 ARDS received a complete coagulation profile at the admission in the intensive care unit. Ten patients were followed in the subsequent 7 days, after increasing the dose of low molecular weight heparin, antithrombin levels correction, and clopidogrel in selected cases. RESULTS: At baseline, the patients showed a pro-coagulant profile characterized by an increased clot strength (CS, median 55 hPa, 95% interquartile range 35-63), platelet contribution to CS (PCS, 43 hPa, interquartile range 24-45), fibrinogen contribution to CS (FCS, 12 hPa, interquartile range 6-13.5 elevated D-dimer levels (5.5 mug/mL, interquartile range 2.5-6.5), hyperfibrinogenemia (794 mg/dL, interquartile range 583-933). Fibrinogen levels were associated (R(2) =0.506, P=0.003) with interleukin-6 values. After increasing the thromboprophylaxis, there was a significant (P=0.001) time-related decrease of fibrinogen levels, D-dimers (P=0.017), CS (P=0.013), PCS (P=0.035) and FCS (P=0.038). CONCLUSION: The pro-coagulant pattern of these patients may justify the clinical reports of thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism) during the course of the disease.
