METHODS: A review of the MEDLINE database was performed on April 13th, 2020. Search terms included \"COVID-19\", \"neurosurgery,\" and \"surgery\". A review of documents published on the web-page of the WFNS and of the 5 continental associations of neurosurgical societies AANS, AASNS, CAANS, EANS, and FLANC representing the 119 national Neurosurgical Societies around the world was performed. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 38 results that were manually reviewed. Fourteen manuscripts were considered eligible. They described suggestions and considerations to optimize care of neurosurgical patients, editorials on operational models, perspectives from neurosurgical departments, letters to the editor describing experiences on how to help medical staff to be prepared in advance for pandemic situations, description of regional or departmental models and/or organizational schemes.
