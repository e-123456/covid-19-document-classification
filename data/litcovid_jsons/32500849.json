Recent data suggested the utility of lung ultrasound (LUS) in the diagnosis of COVID-19 by detecting an interstitial pattern (B-pattern). Hence, we aimed to pool the proportion of various reported lung abnormalities detected by LUS in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. We conducted a systematic review (PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE until April 25, 2020) and a proportion meta-analysis. We included seven studies examining the role of LUS in 122 COVID-19 patients. The pooled proportion (PP) of B-pattern detected by lung ultrasound (US) was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00 I (2) 0%, Q 4.6). The PP of finding pleural line abnormalities was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.13-1.00 I (2) 96%, Q 103.9), of pleural thickening was 0.54 (95% 0.11-0.95 I (2) 93%, Q 61.1), of subpleural or pulmonary consolidation was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.21-0.58 I (2) 72%, Q 17.8), and of pleural effusion was 0.14 (95% CI: 0.00-0.37 I (2) 93%, Q 27.3). Our meta-analysis revealed that almost all SARS-CoV-2-infected patients have abnormal lung US. The most common abnormality is interstitial involvement depicted as B-pattern.

The diagnosis of mild disease was made clinically which was later reaffirmed by LUS after identifying a bilateral small pleural effusion and a thickened pleural line. During follow up, subpleural consolidations appeared before symptoms slightly aggravated (cough, tiredness and fever). The patient's condition improved after adjustment of therapy at home. CONCLUSION: LUS is an excellent tool in the characterisation of COVID-19 infection and is more available than CT or X-ray.
