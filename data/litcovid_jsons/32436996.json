METHODS: Clinical data of 443 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital were retrospectively analyzed, which were divided into non-severe group (n=304) and severe group (n=139) according to their condition. Clinical indicators were compared between different groups. RESULTS: The differences in gender, age, the proportion of patients with combined heart disease, leukocyte, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet, D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase and albumin on admission between the two groups were statistically significant (p<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed NLR and CRP were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19. Platelets were independent protective factors for severe COVID-19. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated area under the curve (AUC) of NLR, platelet, CRP and combination was 0.737, 0.634, 0.734 and 0.774, respectively.
