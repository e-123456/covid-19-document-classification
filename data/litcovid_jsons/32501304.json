This makes it difficult for international business managers to understand the types of uncertainty in their businesses and develop appropriate strategies to deal with it effectively, especially during times such as the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. This paper uses an extensive review of the international business literature to address the above research gap by identifying the different types of uncertainty, their antecedents and outcomes, the coping strategies used to mitigate their impact, and the consequences of these actions.

AIMS: To understand the behaviour of OHS in different parts of the country during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online survey link was sent to both accredited and unaccredited UK Occupational Health Physicians (OHPs). RESULTS: Sixty-two OHPs responded to the survey. In the current pandemic, 51% of the OHS (95% CI 0.38-0.62) offered weekend or out-of-hours (OOH) services, 21% had to employ extra staff (95% CI 0.13-0.33) and 54% had to change their working hours (95% CI 0.41-0.65). Ninety per cent of the OHS (95% CI 0.78-0.94) continued to offer routine services; however, there was a decline in offering vaccination services. Fifty-six per cent of the OHS (95% CI 0.42-0.67) offered a dedicated telephone line and 46% of the OHS (95% CI 0.32-0.56) started a dedicated COVID-19 queries inbox.
