We aimed to review the public health interventions used during the COVID-19 outbreak and describe the impact on seasonal influenza activity in Korea. METHODS: National response strategies and public health interventions, along with daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Korea were reviewed during the pandemic. National influenza surveillance data were compared between seven sequential seasons. Characteristics of each season, including the rate of influenza-like illness (ILI), duration of epidemic, date of termination of epidemic, distribution of influenza virus strain and hospitalization were analyzed. RESULTS: After various public health interventions including enforced public education on hand hygiene, cough etiquette and staying at home with respiratory symptoms, universal mask use in public places, refrain from non-essential social activities and school closure, the duration of the influenza epidemic in 2019/2020 decreased by 6-12 weeks and the influenza activity peak rated 49.8 ILI/1,000 visits compared to 71.9-86.2 ILI/1,000 visits of previous seasons. During the period of enforced social distancing from week 9 to 17 of 2020, influenza hospitalization cases were 11.9-26.9-fold lower compared with previous seasons. During the 2019/2020 season, influenza B accounted for only 4%, in contrast with previous seasons in which influenza B accounted for 26.6% to 54.9% of all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to activate high level national response not only led to a decrease in COVID-19, but also substantial decrease in seasonal influenza activity. Interventions applied to control COVID-19 may serve as useful strategies for prevention and control of influenza in upcoming seasons.","Clin Infect Dis","Lee, Hyunju","Lee, Heeyoung","Song, Kyoung-Ho","Kim, Eu Suk","Park, Jeong Su","Jung, Jongtak","Ahn, Soyeon","Jeong, Eun Kyeong","Park, Hyekyung","Kim, Hong Bin","32472687"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was introduced in Korea early and experienced a large outbreak in mid-February.

We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioural changes of the public on the incidence of COVID-19, as well as on influenza virus infections, which might share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. METHODS: We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 to estimate changes in transmissibility over time.

FINDINGS: COVID-19 transmissibility measured by Rt has remained at approximately 1 for 8 weeks in Hong Kong. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% CI 34-53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, from an estimated Rt of 1.28 (95% CI 1.26-1.30) before the start of the school closures to 0.72 (0.70-0.74) during the closure weeks. Similarly, a 33% (24-43%) reduction in transmissibility was seen based on paediatric hospitalisation rates, from an Rt of 1.10 (1.06-1.12) before the start of the school closures to 0.73 (0.68-0.77) after school closures.
