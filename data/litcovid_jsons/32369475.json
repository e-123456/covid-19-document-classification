It can be transmitted by contact, drops and aerosols, and has been isolated from gastrointestinal secretions and faeces. During digestive endoscopy, transmission by any of these mechanisms could occur. It is recommended to limit digestive endoscopy to cases of digestive bleeding, severe dysphagia, foreign body in the digestive tract, biliary obstruction with intractable pain or cholangitis, pseudocyst or complicated encapsulated pancreatic necrosis, gastrointestinal obstruction, and cases at risk of deterioration over time. It is recommended to screen patients based on temperature, symptoms, and epidemiological factors to classify them according to their risk of infection. For procedures in low risk patients, personnel must wear a disposable gown, gloves, eye or face shield, standard surgical mask, disposable hat, disposable shoe covers. In cases of intermediate or high risk, or confirmed COVID-19, protection should be increased using disposable waterproof gown, N95 respirator or similar, and double glove. In case of shortage it may be necessary to reuse N95 respirators for up to 5 uses, following CDC recommendations for donning, removing and storing to prevent secondary contact contamination. Likewise, all protective equipment should be put on and removed according to CDC recommendations. The presence of personnel in endoscopy should be limited to the bare minimum. Said personnel must have daily temperature control and if it is above 37.3 masculineC, the corresponding evaluation must be carried out.
