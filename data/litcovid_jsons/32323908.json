Our history of agility in learning and teaching is now only inhibited by the time constraints of current clinical demands on the genetics community. This publication is designed to offer ideas and resources for quickly transitioning our education to meet the current demands in the time of a pandemic.

The key opportunities recognized for anatomy education included: enabling synchronous teaching across remote sites, expanding offerings into the remote learning space, and embracing new pedagogies. In managing anatomy education's transition in response to the pandemic, six critical elements were identified: community care, clear communications, clarified expectations, constructive alignment, community of practice, ability to compromise and adapt and continuity planning.
