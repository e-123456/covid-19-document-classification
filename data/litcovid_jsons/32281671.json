Here, we report another series of cases and further demonstrate the repeatability of the transmission of COVID-19 by pre-symptomatic carriers. METHODS: A familial cluster of five patients associated with COVID-19 was enrolled in the hospital. We collected epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory outcomes from electronic medical records, and also affirmed them with the patients and their families. RESULTS: Among them, three family members (Case 3/4/5) had returned from Wuhan. Additionally, two family members, those who had not travelled to Wuhan, also contracted COVID-19 after contacting with the other three family members. Case 1 developed severe pneumonia and was admitted to the ICU. Case 3 and Case 5 presented fever and cough on days 2 through 3 of hospitalization and had ground-glass opacity changes in their lungs. Case 4 presented with diarrhoea and pharyngalgia after admission without radiographic abnormalities. Case 2 presented no clinical or radiographic abnormalities. All the cases had an increasing level of C-reactive protein.
