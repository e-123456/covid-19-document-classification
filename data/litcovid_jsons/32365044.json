The first and most draconian interventions have been implemented in Wuhan, China, and these countermeasures have been increasingly deployed by countries around the world. OBJECTIVE: We examined risk factors, including the use of social media use, for probable anxiety and depression in the community and health professionals in the epicentre, Wuhan, China. METHODS: We conducted an online survey via WeChat, the most widely used social media platform in China, which was administered to 1,577 community adults and 214 health professionals in Wuhan. Probable anxiety and probable depression were assessed by the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (cutoff >/= 3) and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (cutoff >/= 3), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with probable anxiety and probable depression. RESULTS: One fifth of respondents in the community reported probable anxiety (23.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 22.0 to 26.4) and probable depression (19.2%; 95% CI, 17.5 to 21.5). Similarly, one in five surveyed health professionals reported probable anxiety (22.0%; 95% CI, 16.6 to 28.1) or probable depression (19.2%; 95% CI, 14.1 to 25.1). Around one third of community-based adults and health professionals spent 2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media. Close contact with individuals with COVID-19 and spending 2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media were associated with probable anxiety and depression in community-based adults. Social support was associated with less probable anxiety and depression in both health professionals and community-based adults. CONCLUSIONS: The internet could be harnessed for telemedicine and restoring daily routines, yet caution is warranted on excessive time spent on COVID-19 news on social media given the infodemic and emotional contagion through online social networks. Online platforms may be used to monitor the toll of the pandemic on mental health.","JMIR Public Health Surveill","Ni, Michael Y","Yang, Lin","Leung, Candi Mc","Li, Na","Yao, Xiaoxin I","Wang, Yishan","Leung, Gabriel M","Cowling, Benjamin J","Liao, Qiuyan","32365044"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: The mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, community-wide interventions, and social media use during a pandemic are unclear.

Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P < .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P < .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19."],"journal":"JAMA Netw Open","authors":["Lai, Jianbo","Ma, Simeng","Wang, Ying","Cai, Zhongxiang","Hu, Jianbo","Wei, Ning","Wu, Jiang","Du, Hui","Chen, Tingting","Li, Ruiting","Tan, Huawei","Kang, Lijun","Yao, Lihua","Huang, Manli","Wang, Huafen","Wang, Gaohua","Liu, Zhongchun","Hu, Shaohua"],"date":"2020-03-24T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32202646","source":"PubMed","week":"202013|Mar 23 - Mar 29","doi":"10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.3976","link_comment_in":"32202641","locations":["China","China","Chinese","Wuhan","Wuhan","China","Wuhan","Hubei","Wuhan","Hubei","Hubei","Wuhan","Hubei","Hubei","Wuhan","Wuhan","China","Wuhan"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"weight":0,"_version_":1666138492416032769,"score":314.71045}]}
