The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 24, 2020 were investigated and prediction was made until April 15, 2020. METHODS: By estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, time-dependent recovery rate, and timedependent death rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package. RESULTS: Based on our predictions of Iran about 29000 people will be infected from March 25 to April 15, 2020. On average, 1292 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran.
