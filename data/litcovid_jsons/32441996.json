Physical (social) distancing - a counter-measure with no alternative, but with no precedence in scope and scale either - is a key intervention and trigger of natural experiments.

From the field of chronobiology, prolonged home stays may place undue strain on the body's circadian timing system but straightforward and often underestimated advice for coping can be provided (herein we provide such advice).
