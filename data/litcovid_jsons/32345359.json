According to a indicator case from ZH supermarkets, close contacts and related subjects were tracked and screened on February 1, including ZH supermarket employees, family members having contact history with related cases during January 13-26, supermarket clients during January 16-30 and family members of related cases. an epidemiological investigation was carried on and their swab of nose /throat were collected and were sent to Liaocheng CDC laboratory, real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2. Results: a total of 8 437 people were screened during January 30 to February 9, 2020 (120 employees of supermarket, 93 family members, and 8224 clients of supermarket). The epidemic was caused by ZH cases and brought clustered cases in four families. A total 25 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the total infection rate of subjects was 0.30% (25/8 437) with 22 confirmed cases (0.26%, 22/8 437) and 3 asymptomatic patients (0.04%, 3/8 437), asymptomatic patients accounted for 12.00% (3/25) of all infection cases. The infection rates of supermarket employees, family members of confirmed cases and supermarket clients were 9.17% (11/120), 12.90% (12/93) and 0.02% (2/8 224).

We reported on the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of children cases to help health workers better understand and provide timely diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Retrospectively, two research centers' case series of 67 consecutive hospitalized cases including 53 adult and 14 children cases with COVID-19 between 23 Jan 2020 and 15 Feb 2020 from Jinan and Rizhao were enrolled in this study.

RESULTS: Most cases in children were mild (21.4%) and conventional cases (78.6%), with mild clinical signs and symptoms, and all cases were of family clusters. Fever (35.7%) and dry cough (21.4%) were described as clinical manifestations in children cases. Dry cough and phlegm were not the most common symptoms in children compared with adults (p = 0.03).

CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms of children are mild, there is substantial lung injury even among children, but that there is less clinical disease, perhaps because of a less pronounced inflammatory response, and that the occurrence of this pattern appears to inversely correlate with age.","Infection","Du, Wenjun","Yu, Jinhong","Wang, Hui","Zhang, Xiaoguo","Zhang, Shouwei","Li, Qiang","Zhang, Zhongfa","32301099"],"abstract":["AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak spread in China and is a threat to the world.
