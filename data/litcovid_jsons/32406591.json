METHODS: We searched for information on ehealth services related to the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. The sources of information were mainstream search engines such as Baidu and the popular interactive social platforms such as Webchat. The keywords were \"Internet+pneumonia\", \"Internet clinic\", \"pneumonia online clinic\" and so on. The time of information was from January 20 to February 3, 2020. The key information was extracted and encoded by two persons back-to-back. The coding information included: name of organization provider, launching time, location of provider, service items, user, health workers engaging in the service, and so on. The coded information was entered and analyzed with SPSS 24.0 and Excel. RESULTS: There were totally 57 projects launched by local governments, hospitals and IT companies.

Vulnerable populations to this outbreak and its physical and mental health impact include community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. Telehealth is becoming a potential major tool to deliver healthcare and support preventing the risk of exposure. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was threefold: 1) to explore the physical and mental health and well-being impact of confinement in community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, 2) to provide TV-based and telephone-based health and social support, and 3) to study the effect of a TV-based assistive integrated technology (TV-AssistDem). METHODS: A telephone-based survey was administered in Spain to 93 participants of the TV-AssistDem clinical trial from the 25th of March to 6th of April 2020. RESULTS: 60(65%) respondents were women, aged 73. 34 (SD=6.07) and 69(74%) lived accompanied. Lockdown measures forced 17(18%) to change their living arrangements. Health status was found optimal in 89 (96%) with no COVID-19 symptoms. Grocery and pharmacy outings were done by family members in 68(73%). 57(61%) respondents reported overall well-being and 65(70%) maintained sleep. However, those living alone presented greater negative feelings and sleeping problems. Regarding leisure activities, 53(57%) went on walks, 32(35%) did memory games, 55(60%) watched TV, and 91(98%) telephone called relatives. 58(64%) respondents reported accessing moderately or too much COVID-19 information, using 89(97%) Television sets, and 56 (62%) stated understanding this information in extreme. 39(39%) respondents had contacted health and social services whilst 29(31%) requested information regarding these services during the telephone call. Regarding differences between the intervention and control group there were no significant differences in health and well-being. Respondents with TV-AssistDem did more memory exercises (52% vs. 17.4%; P<.001) than controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that during the coronavirus disease confinement the physical and mental health and well-being of our vulnerable population at risk was overall optimal. However, those living alone reported greater psychological negative impact and sleeping problems. Measures adopted to face the negative experience of confinement included: keeping well informed of the situation and accessing health and social services, counting with a support network which prevented risk of exposure to COVID-19 and guaranteed food and medical supplies, a daily routine with maintained sleeping habits and leisure activities, staying physically and mentally active with cognitive stimulation exercises, and ensuring social connectedness using technologies. Television sets stood out as preferred technological devices to access COVID-19 information, watch TV as a recreational activity, and do memory exercises as an intellectual activity.

One specific application is to monitor compliance of website and social media activity with respect to jurisdictional regulations. These data may then identify breaches of compliance and inform disciplinary actions. Our study aimed to evaluate the novel use of internet analytics by a Canadian chiropractic regulator to determine their registrants compliance with three regulations related to specific health conditions, pregnancy conditions and most recently, claims of improved immunity during the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: A customized internet search tool (Market Review Tool, MRT) was used by the College of Chiropractors of British Columbia (CCBC), Canada to audit registrants websites and social media activity. The audits extracted words whose use within specific contexts is not permitted under CCBC guidelines. The MRT was first used in October of 2018 to identify words related to specific health conditions. The MRT was again used in December 2019 for words related to pregnancy and most recently in March 2020 for words related to COVID-19. In these three MRT applications, potential cases of word misuse were evaluated by the regulator who then notified the practitioner to comply with existing regulations by a specific date. The MRT was then used on that date to determine compliance. Those found to be non-compliant were referred to the regulator's inquiry committee. We mapped this process and reported the outcomes with permission of the regulator. RESULTS: In September 2018, 250 inappropriate mentions of specific health conditions were detected from approximately 1250 registrants with 2 failing to comply. The second scan for pregnancy related terms of approximately1350 practitioners revealed 83 inappropriate mentions. Following notification, all 83 cases were compliant within the specified timeframe. Regarding COVID-19 related words, 97 inappropriate mentions of the word \"immune\" were detected from 1350 registrants with 7 cases of non-compliance. CONCLUSION: Internet analytics are an effective way for regulators to monitor internet activity to protect the public from misleading statements. The processes described were effective at bringing about rapid practitioner compliance. Given the increasing volume of internet activity by healthcare professionals, internet analytics are an important addition for health care regulators to protect the public they serve.","Chiropr Man Therap","Kawchuk, Greg","Hartvigsen, Jan","Innes, Stan","Simpson, J Keith","Gushaty, Brian","32393394"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Internet analytics are increasingly being integrated into public health regulation.
