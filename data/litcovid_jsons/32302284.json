RESULTS: The group working on the front lines had a lower frequency of burnout (13% versus 39%, P < .0001), and were less worried about being infected compared to the usual ward group. CONCLUSION: Compared to medical staff working on their usual wards for uninfected patients, medical staff working on the COVID-19 front line had a lower frequency of burnout.
