Delirium, the detection of which takes less than two minutes, is frequently underestimated during daily routine ICU care, but it may be a prodromal symptom of infection or hypoxia associated with severe respiratory failure. During the COVID-19 pandemic, systematic delirium monitoring using validated tests (CAM-ICU or ICDSC) may be sacrificed. This is likely to be due to the fact that the main emphasis is placed on organisational issues, i.e. the lack of ventilators, setting priorities for limited mechanical ventilation options, and a shortage of personal protective equipment. Early identification of patients with delirium is critical in patients with COVID-19 because the occurrence of delirium may be an early symptom of worsening respiratory failure or of infectious spread to the CNS mediated by potential neuroinvasive mechanisms of the coronavirus. The purpose of this review is to identify problems related to the development of delirium during the COVID-19 epidemic, which are presented in three areas: i) factors contributing to delirium in COVID-19, ii) potential pathophysiological factors of delirium in COVID-19, and iii) long-term consequences of delirium in COVID-19.

The early reports of 25% encephalopathy from China are likely a gross underestimation, which we know occurs whenever delirium is not monitored with a valid tool. Indeed, patients with COVID-19 are at accelerated risk for delirium due to at least seven factors including (1) direct central nervous system (CNS) invasion, (2) induction of CNS inflammatory mediators, (3) secondary effect of other organ system failure, (4) effect of sedative strategies, (5) prolonged mechanical ventilation time, (6) immobilization, and (7) other needed but unfortunate environmental factors including social isolation and quarantine without family.
