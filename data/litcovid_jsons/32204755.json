A number of cases of neonates born to mothers with 2019-nCoV pneumonia have been recorded. However, the clinical features of these cases have not been reported, and there is no sufficient evidence for the proper prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infections in neonates. Methods: The clinical features and outcomes of 10 neonates (including 2 twins) born to 9 mothers with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in 5 hospitals from January 20 to February 5, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Among these 9 pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, onset of clinical symptoms occurred before delivery in 4 cases, on the day of delivery in 2 cases, and after delivery in 3 cases. In most cases, fever and a cough were the first symptoms experienced, and 1 patient also had diarrhea. Of the newborns born to these mothers, 8 were male and 2 were female; 4 were full-term infants and 6 were born premature; 2 were small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants and 1 was a large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infant; there were 8 singletons and 2 twins. Of the neonates, 6 had a Pediatric Critical Illness Score (PCIS) score of less than 90. Clinically, the first symptom in the neonates was shortness of breath (n=6), but other initial symptoms such as fever (n=2), thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function (n=2), rapid heart rate (n=1), vomiting (n=1), and pneumothorax (n=1) were observed. Up to now, 5 neonates have been cured and discharged, 1 has died, and 4 neonates remain in hospital in a stable condition. Pharyngeal swab specimens were collected from 9 of the 10 neonates 1 to 9 days after birth for nucleic acid amplification tests for 2019-nCoV, all of which showed negative results. Conclusions: Perinatal 2019-nCoV infection may have adverse effects on newborns, causing problems such as fetal distress, premature labor, respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function, and even death.
