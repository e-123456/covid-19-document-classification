How Good Is the Evidence?","Ibuprofen is an over-the-counter medication that is used widely for the treatment of pain and fever during COVID-19 pandemic. A concern was raised regarding the safety of ibuprofen use because of its role in increasing ACE2 levels within the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system. ACE2 is the coreceptor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells, and so, a potential increased risk of contracting COVID-19 disease and/or worsening of COVID-19 infection was feared with ibuprofen use. However, available data from limited studies show administration of recombinant ACE2 improves lung damage caused by respiratory viruses, suggesting ibuprofen use may be beneficial in COVID-19 disease. At this time, there is no supporting evidence to discourage the use of ibuprofen.","Am J Ther","Sridharan, Gurusaravanan Kutti","Kotagiri, Rajesh","Chandiramani, Vijay H","Mohan, Babu P","Vegunta, Rathnamitreyee","Vegunta, Radhakrishna","Rokkam, Venkata R P","32366740"],"abstract":["Ibuprofen is an over-the-counter medication that is used widely for the treatment of pain and fever during COVID-19 pandemic.

In view of the inconsistent and limited evidence and after weighing up the benefits and risks, we would not currently recommend discontinuing or switching an effective treatment with RAS blockers. NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period.
