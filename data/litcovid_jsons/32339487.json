METHODS: All confirmed cases with COVID-19 in Wenzhou from January 19 to February 20, 2020, were collected and analyzed. Of the 116 patients with COVID-19, 27 were diagnosed as severe cases.

RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 have lower counts of leucocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, platelets, and hemoglobin, but have higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), which were compared with controls (P<0.001).

In addition, the time that it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was significantly shorter for patients in the mild group than for those in the severe group (Z = -6.713, p < 0.001). In conclusion, relative SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in the nasopharynx is closely related to COVID-19 severity. If the relative RNA load was higher, the lymphocyte count was lower, organ damage was greater, and the time it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was longer."],"journal":"Viral Immunol","authors":["Liu, Yang","Liao, Wenjian","Wan, Lagen","Xiang, Tianxing","Zhang, Wei"],"date":"2020-04-17T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32297828","week":"202016|Apr 13 - Apr 19","doi":"10.1089/vim.2020.0062","keywords":["covid-19","lymphocyte count","nasopharyngeal virus rna load","organ damage"],"source":"PubMed","topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1664641388320391170,"score":390.4772}]}
