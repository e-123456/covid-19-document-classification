MATERIALS AND METHODS: A protective face shield consisting in a standard transparent polymerizing vinyl chloride (PVC) sheet was built using commercially available 3D printers. The 3D-printed face shield was evaluated in 31 interventional procedures in terms of ability to perform the assigned intervention as usual, quality of visual comfort and tolerance using a Likert scale (from 1, as very good to 5, as extremely poor). RESULTS: The mean rating for ability to perform the assigned intervention as usual was 1.7+/-0.8 (SD) (range: 1-4). The mean visual tolerance rating was 1.6+/-0.7 (SD) (range: 1-4). The mean tolerability rating was 1.4+/-0.7 (SD) (range: 1-3). CONCLUSION: The 3D-printed protective face shield is well accepted in various interventions.
