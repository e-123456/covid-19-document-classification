Purpose: To examine the burden of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV on HCWs and risk factors for infection, using rapid and living review methods. Data Sources: Multiple electronic databases including the WHO Database of Publications on Coronavirus Disease and medRxiv preprint server (2003 through 27 March 2020, with ongoing surveillance through 24 April 2020), and reference lists.

New evidence will be incorporated on an ongoing basis by using living review methods. Data Extraction: One reviewer abstracted data and assessed methodological limitations; verification was done by a second reviewer.
