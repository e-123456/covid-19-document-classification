These changes are particularly relevant to otolaryngology - head and neck surgery (OHNS) residents, as reports suggest an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 for otolaryngologists. The objectives of this study were to evaluate OHNS residency program practice changes and characterize resident perceptions during the initial phase of the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of U.S. OHNS residents at 81 programs was conducted between March 23-29, 2020. RESULTS: 82 residents from 51 institutions (63% of invited programs) responded. At time of survey, 98% of programs had enacted policy changes to minimize COVID-19 spread. These included filtered respirator use for aerosol-generating procedures even in COVID-19-negative patients (85%), decreased resident staffing of surgeries (70%), and reduced frequency of tracheotomy care (61%). The majority of residents (66%) perceived that residents were at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to attendings. Residents were most concerned about protective equipment shortage (93%) and transmitting COVID-19 to patients (90%). The majority of residents (73%) were satisfied with their department's COVID-19 response. Resident satisfaction correlated with comfort level in discussing concerns with attendings (r=0.72, p<0.00001) and inversely correlated with perceptions of increased risk compared to attendings (r=-0.52, p < 0.00001). CONCLUSION: U.S. OHNS residency programs implemented policy changes quickly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sources of resident anxieties demonstrate the importance of open communication and an integrated team approach to facilitate optimal patient and provider care during this unprecedented crisis.

The objective of this study was to investigate the droplet and splatter contamination from common otologic procedures. STUDY DESIGN: Cadaver simulation series. SETTING: Dedicated surgical laboratory. METHODS: Two cadaver heads were prepped via bilateral middle cranial fossa approaches to the tegmen (n = 4). Fluorescein was instilled through a 4-mm burr hole drilled into the middle cranial fossa floor, and presence in the middle ear was confirmed via microscopic ear examination. Myringotomy with ventilation tube placement and mastoidectomy were performed, and the distribution and distance of resulting droplet splatter patterns were systematically evaluated. RESULTS: There were no fluorescein droplets or splatter contamination observed in the measured surgical field in any direction after myringotomy and insertion of ventilation tube. Gross contamination from the surgical site to 6 ft was noted after complete mastoidectomy, though, when performed in standard fashion. CONCLUSION: Our results show that there is no droplet generation during myringotomy with ventilation tube placement in an operating room setting. Mastoidectomy, however, showed gross contamination 3 to 6 ft away in all directions measured.

To describe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient presentations requiring otolaryngology consultation and provide recommendations for protective measures based on the experience of ear, nose, and throat (ENT) departments in 4 Chinese hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study Design. Retrospective case series. Setting. Multicenter. Subjects and Methods. Twenty hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring ENT consultation from 3 designated COVID-19 hospitals in Wuhan, Shanghai, and Shenzhen were identified. Data on demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms and severity, consult reason, treatment, and personal protective equipment (PPE) use were collected and analyzed.

Median age was 63 years, 55% were male, and 95% were in severe or critical condition. Six tracheotomies were performed. Posttracheotomy outcomes were mixed (2 deaths, 2 patients comatose, all living patients still hospitalized). Other consults included epistaxis, pharyngitis, nasal congestion, hyposmia, rhinitis, otitis externa, dizziness, and tinnitus. At all hospitals, powered air-supply filter respirators (PAPRs) were used for tracheotomy or bleeding control. PAPR or N95-equivalent masks plus full protective clothing were used for other complaints. No inpatient ENT providers were infected.
