OBJECTIVE: The scientific community, citizens, politicians and mass media are arguing over data that seem to suggest that Italy has a significantly higher number of COVID-19-related deaths than in the rest of the world. Moreover, Italian citizens have a misleading perception related to the number of actually performed swab tests. Citizens and mass media denounce that the coverage obtained by COVID-19 swab testing in Italy is not in line with other countries all over the world. METHODS: In this paper, we try to clarify, with a set of statistical analysis conducted world-wide, both aspects by highlighting the actual numbers and by comparing them with the official data available. RESULTS: The analysis clearly shows that the Italian COVID-19 fatality and mortality rate are in line with the official world scenario, and these findings are true also for the number of COVID-19 swabs performed in Italy and in Lombardy Region. CONCLUSIONS: Up-to-date analysis of this type may simplify the understanding of the pandemic evolution.
