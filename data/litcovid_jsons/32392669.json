Since COVID-19 spreads through contact and droplet infection routes, careful attention to infection control and surgical management is important to prevent cross-contamination of patients and medical staff. Tracheostomy is an effective method to treat severe respiratory dysfunction with prolonged respiratory management and should be performed as a high-risk procedure METHOD: The anesthetic and surgical considerations in this case involved difficult goals of the patient safety and the management of infection among health care workers.
