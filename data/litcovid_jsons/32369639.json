Our focus is on the implications for nurses, who are the largest global health care workforce but whose perspectives are not always fully considered. This essay discusses three overarching ethical issues that create a myriad of concerns and will likely affect nurses globally in unique ways: the safety of nurses, patients, colleagues, and families; the allocation of scarce resources; and the changing nature of nurses' relationships with patients and families. We urge policy-makers to ensure that nurses' voices and perspectives are integrated into both local and global decision-making so as to minimize the structural injustices many nurses have faced to date.
