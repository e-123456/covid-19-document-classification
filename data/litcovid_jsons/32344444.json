Across the United States, social distancing measures have been put in place, including stay-at-home orders (SAH), to combat the spread of this infection. This has impacted the type and volume of traumatic injuries sustained during this time.

Using comparative data, we aim to describe the trends in traumatic injuries managed by our Plastic Surgery service and detail the changes in consultation policies made to minimize provider exposure. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of all plastic surgery emergencies at our institution during the 3 weeks preceding the issuance of SAH orders in Chicago and the 3 weeks following. The electronic medical record was queried for patient age, type and mechanism of injury, location where injury was sustained, presence of domestic violence, length of inpatient hospital stays and treatment rendered. The two 3-week periods were then comparatively analyzed to determine differences and trends in these variables. and treatment rendered. The two periods were then comparatively analyzed to determine differences and trends in these variables. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in trauma consults since issuance of SAH (88 pre-SAH vs 62 post-SAH) with a marked decrease in trauma related hand injuries. There was an increase in the percentage of assault-related injuries including those associated with domestic violence, while there was an overall decrease in motor vehicle collisions. There was no notable change in the location where injuries were sustained. Significantly fewer patients were seen by house staff in the emergency room, while those requiring surgical intervention were able to receive care without delay.
