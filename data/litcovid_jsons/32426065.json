Measures of quality and barriers for rapid use by patients and physicians are not well described. OBJECTIVE: To describe results from a quality improvement initiative during rapid adoptive phase of telemedicine during the pandemic. DESIGN: Patient and physician satisfaction with synchronous audiovisual telemedicine visits was measured during early adoptive phase (April 6-17, 2020) within the division of sports medicine in an academic Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) department. Patients were invited to participate in a quality improvement initiative by completing an online survey at the end of a telemedicine visit. Physicians completed a separate survey. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient measures included visit type, duration of encounter, quality, and satisfaction. Physicians reported on experiences performing telemedicine. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 119 patients (289 telemedicine encounters, response rate 41%) and 13 physiatrists. Telemedicine was utilized primarily for follow-up visits (n=74, 70.6%) and most common duration was 15-29 minutes. Patients rated their telemedicine visit as \"excellent\" or \"very good\" across measures (91.6-95.0%) including addressing concerns, communication, developing a treatment plan, convenience, and satisfaction. Value of completing a future telemedicine visit was measured at 84.9%. Most reported estimated travel time saved in excess of 30 minutes. Rate of no-show was 2.8%. Most physicians (62%) had no prior experience with telemedicine visits, and most were comfortable performing these visits after completing 1-4 sessions (69%). Nearly all physicians (92%) rated their telemedicine experience as very good or excellent. The key barrier identified for telemedicine was technical issues. All physicians reported plans to perform telemedicine visits if reimbursement continues. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, rapid expansion of telemedicine during COVID-19 pandemic was well-received by a majority of patients and physicians.
