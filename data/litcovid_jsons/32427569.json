RESULTS: Over a 16-week surveillance period, our institution detected 14 cases of COVID-19 amongst HCWs with ARI symptoms. 2 of the cases were linked epidemiologically and thus constituted a COVID-19 cluster with HCW-HCW transmission occurring intra-hospital; we also detected one family cluster and two clusters amongst HCWs who shared accommodation.
