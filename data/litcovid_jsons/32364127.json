Here, we investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic affects acute stroke care through interruptions in the stroke chain of survival. METHODS: A descriptive analysis of acute stroke care activity before and after the COVID-19 outbreak is given for a stroke network in southern Europe. To quantify the impact of the pandemic, the number of stroke code activations, ambulance transfers, consultations through telestroke, stroke unit admissions, and reperfusion therapy times and rates are described in temporal relationship with the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the region. RESULTS: Following confinement of the population, our stroke unit activity decreased sharply, with a 25% reduction in admitted cases (mean number of 58 cases every 15 days in previous months to 44 cases in the 15 days after the outbreak, P<0.001). Consultations to the telestroke network declined from 25 every 15 days before the outbreak to 7 after the outbreak (P<0.001).
