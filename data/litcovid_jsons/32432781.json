Elective surgery has comprehensively been drastically limited and allocating intensive care beds to emergency cases or to high risk scheduled elective cases has become an even more difficult task. Here we present our experience which could help to handle undelayable surgical procedures during this emergency. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 2019, eight patients (4 men, 4 women) with a mean age of 88 years, needing emergency abdominal surgery underwent awake open surgery at our Department of Surgery. All of them were identified as fragile patients at preoperative evaluation by the anesthesiologist. In all cases, locoregional anesthesia (spinal, epidural or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia) was performed. Intraoperative and postoperative pain has been monitored and regularly assessed. RESULTS: None of the patients was intubated. Mean operative time was 80 minutes (minimum 30 minutes, maximum 130 minutes). Intraoperative and postoperative pain were both well controlled. None of them required postoperative intensive care support. No perioperative complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our preliminary case series, awake open surgery has resulted feasible and safe. This approach has allowed to perform undelayable major abdominal surgeries on fragile patients when intensive care beds were not available. Surely, it represents a helpful alternative in the COVID-19 era. A streamlining of workflows would fast-track both fragile patients management, as well as healthcare workers' tasks and activity.","Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci","Romanzi, A","Galletti, M","Macchi, L","Putorti, A","Rossi, F","Scolaro, R","Vannelli, A","32432781"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: Over the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the demand for critical care beds among medical services has rapidly exceeded its supply.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of parturients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection disease (COVID-19). Their epidemiologic history, chest computed tomography scans, laboratory measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity were evaluated. We also recorded the patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal complications, as well as the health status of the involved medical staff. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult patients. All of the 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures. Fourteen of the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing significant intraoperative hypotension. Three patients received general anesthesia with tracheal intubation because emergency surgery was needed. Three of the parturients are still recovering from their Cesarean delivery and are receiving in-hospital treatment for COVID-19. Three neonates were born prematurely. There were no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events. All neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative. No medical staff were infected throughout the patient care period. CONCLUSIONS: Both epidural and general anesthesia were safely used for Cesarean delivery in the parturients with COVID-19.

In general surgery, locoregional anaesthesia was applied to laparoscopic procedures, increasing minimally invasive surgery advantages. Aims: To assess and compare postoperative pain after laparoscopic adnexal procedures for benign conditions under spinal anaesthesia (SA) versus general anaesthesia (GA). Furthermore, anaesthesiologic, surgical and clinical data were evaluated in both groups. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective cohort study performed in a tertiary level referral centre for minimally invasive gynaecological surgery (Gynaecology and Human Reproduction Physiopathology, University of Bologna).

A sample size of 13 women per group was needed to detect a 2-point difference in pain scores. Main findings: 13 women were enrolled in the SA arm, 15 in the GA arm. In the SA cohort, the most common intraoperative adverse event was shoulder pain, reported by 3/12 women.

Conclusions: SA is a feasible, safe and effective anaesthesiologic technique for laparoscopic gynaecological procedures for benign conditions, allowing a better control of postoperative pain.

While most medical resources are allocated to treat COVID-19 patients, several non-COVID-19 medical emergencies still need to be treated, including vertebral fractures and spinal cord compression. The aim of this paper is to report the early experience and an organizational protocol for emergency spinal surgery currently being used in a large metropolitan area by an integrated team of orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons. METHODS: An organizational model is presented based on case centralization in hub hospitals and early management of surgical cases to reduce hospital stay. Data from all the patients admitted for emergency spinal surgery from the beginning of the outbreak were prospectively collected and compared to data from patients admitted for the same reason in the same time span in the previous year, and treated by the same integrated team. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients (11 males and eight females, with a mean age of 49.9 years (14 to 83)) were admitted either for vertebral fracture or spinal cord compression in a 19-day period, compared to the ten admitted in the previous year. No COVID-19 patients were treated. The mean time between admission and surgery was 1.7 days, significantly lower than 6.8 days the previous year (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The structural organization and the management protocol we describe allowed us to reduce the time to surgery and ultimately hospital stay, thereby maximizing the already stretched medical resources available.
