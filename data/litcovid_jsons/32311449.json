METHODS: Surfaces of objects were routinely wiped with 1, 000mg/L chlorine containing disinfectant. Air and sewage disinfection was proceeded routinely and strictly. Hospital environmental surfaces and PPE of staffs in isolation wards were sampled using swabs. The sewage from various inlet and outlets were sampled. The respiratory and stool specimens of patients were collected. The respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were also sampled once a week. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) methods were used to confirm the existence of SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Viral culture was done for the samples positive for SARS-Cov-2 RNA. RESULTS: During the study period, 33 laboratory-confirmed patients were hospitalized in isolation wards in the hospital. None of SARS-Cov-2 RNA was detected among the 36 objects surface samples and 9 staffs PPE samples in isolation wards. Though the 3 sewage samples from the inlet of preprocessing disinfection pool were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the sample from the outlet of preprocessing disinfection pool was weakly positive, the sewage sample from the outlet of the last disinfection pool was negative. All of the 5 sewage samples from various points were negative by viral culture of SARS-Cov-2. None of the respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were positive. CONCLUSIONS: Though SARS-Cov-2 RNA of the sewage samples were positive from inlets of the sewage disinfection pool and negative from the outlet of the last sewage disinfection pool, no viable virus was detected by culture. The monitoring data in this study suggested that the strict disinfection and hand hygiene could decrease the hospital-associated COVID-19 infection risk of the staffs in isolation wards.","Int J Infect Dis","Wang, Jie","Feng, Haiting","Zhang, Sheng","Ni, Zuowei","Ni, Lingmei","Chen, Yu","Zhuo, Lixin","Zhong, Zifeng","Qu, Tingting","32311449"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper was to monitor the presence of SARS-Cov-2 among hospital environment surfaces, sewage, and personal protective equipment (PPE) of staffs in isolation wards in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, China.

Testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the cornerstone of an effective public health response. However, efforts to test have been hampered by limited reagents, limitations in the availability of swabs used for collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens, limitations in personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare providers collecting the NPS specimens, and limitations in viral transport media for transporting the specimens. Therefore, more flexible options for screening for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses are critical to inform clinical and public health responses. Objective: We aim to document the ability of patients to self-collect specimens for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection and serology. Methods: In this protocol, patient collection of samples will be done with observation by a provider during a telemedicine session. Participants will be mailed a specimen collection kit, engage in a telehealth session with a healthcare provider through a HIPPA-compliant video meeting, and collect specimens while observed by the provider. Providers will record whether they are confident in the sufficiency of the specimen for laboratory testing that would inform clinical decision making. We will objectively assess the laboratory evidence of sufficient biological material in the mailed-in specimens. Conclusions: Defining a conceptual framework for assessing the sufficiency of patient-collected samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses to infection is critical for facilitating public health responses and providing PPE-sparing options to increase testing.
