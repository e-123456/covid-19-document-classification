The origin of the outbreak at the animal market in Wuhan, China implies it as a case of zoonotic spillover. The study was designed to understand evolution of Betacoronaviruses and in particular diversification of SARS-CoV-2 using RdRp gene, a stable genetic marker. METHODS: Phylogenetic and population stratification analyses were carried out using Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, respectively. RESULTS: Molecular phylogeny using RdRp, showed that SARS-CoV-2 isolates cluster together. Bat-CoV isolate RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoVs are observed to branch off prior to SARS-CoV-2 cluster. While SARS-CoV form a single cluster, Bat-CoVs form multiple clusters. Population-based analyses revealed that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV form separate clusters with no admixture. Bat-CoVs were found to have single and mixed ancestry and clustered as four sub-populations. CONCLUSIONS: Population-based analyses of Betacoronaviruses using RdRp, revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is a homogeneous population. SARS-CoV-2 appears to have evolved from Bat-CoV isolate RaTG13, which diversified from a common ancestor from which Pangolin-CoVs have also evolved.
