Results: Compared the data from January 1 to February 20, 2020, with the SV for the same period of previous three years, Hubei's SV for cough, fever, diarrhea, chest tightness, dyspnea and other symptoms were significantly increased. The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms was significantly higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms (P<0.001).
