The aim of this review was to identify the potential risk of transmission associated with key interventions (chest compressions, defibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation) to inform international treatment recommendations. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review comprising three questions: (1) aerosol generation associated with key interventions; (2) risk of airborne infection transmission associated with key interventions; and (3) the effect of different personal protective equipment strategies. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization COVID-19 database on 24th March 2020. Eligibility criteria were developed individually for each question. We assessed risk of bias for individual studies, and used the GRADE process to assess evidence certainty by outcome. RESULTS: We included eleven studies: two cohort studies, one case control study, five case reports, and three manikin randomised controlled trials. We did not find any direct evidence that chest compressions or defibrillation either are or are not associated with aerosol generation or transmission of infection. Data from manikin studies indicates that donning of personal protective equipment delays treatment delivery. Studies provided only indirect evidence, with no study describing patients with COVID-19. Evidence certainty was low or very low for all outcomes. CONCLUSION: It is uncertain whether chest compressions or defibrillation cause aerosol generation or transmission of COVID-19 to rescuers.

Responding to medical emergencies in patients with suspected COVID-19 will require new guidelines and protocols. Simulation can support their development. METHODS: We organised seven simulations involving patients with suspected COVID-19 for staff at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals. Participants completed pre- and post-simulation questionnaires. RESULTS: Fifty-six staff participated and they reported being significantly less prepared to respond to an emergency in a patient with suspected COVID-19 than in one in whom it is not suspected. The simulations significantly improved the participants' confidence in responding to emergencies in patients with suspected COVID-19. Numerous challenges were identified along the themes of equipment, personnel, communication and procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Low-fidelity simulation can provide relevant and timely information on how prepared health systems and their workforce are to respond to emergencies.
