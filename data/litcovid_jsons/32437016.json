METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study including 13 young patients died of COVID-19 and 40 matched survivors. Logistic regression was employed to characterize the risk factors of mortality in young obese COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Most of the young deceased COVID-19 patients were mild cases at the time of admission, but the disease progressed rapidly featured by the higher severity of Patchy shadows (100.00% vs. 48.70%, P = 0.006), pleural thickening (61.50% vs. 12.80%, P = 0.012), mild pericardial effusion (76.90% vs. 0.00%, P < 0.001). Most importantly, the deceased patients manifested higher BMI (OR = 1.354, 95% CI = 1.075-1.704, P = 0.010), inflammatory-related index CRP (OR = 1.014, 95% CI = 1.003-1.025, P = 0.014), cardiac injury biomarker hs-cTnI (OR = 1.420, 95% CI = 1.112-1.814, P = 0.005), and increased coagulation activity biomarker D-Dimer (OR = 418.7, P = 0.047), as compared to that of survivors.
