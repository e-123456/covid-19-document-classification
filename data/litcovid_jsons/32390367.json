The clinical progression pattern suggests that early control of viral replication and application of host-directed therapy in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of CVOID-19."],"journal":"J Infect","authors":["Chen, Jun","Qi, Tangkai","Liu, Li","Ling, Yun","Qian, Zhiping","Li, Tao","Li, Feng","Xu, Qingnian","Zhang, Yuyi","Xu, Shuibao","Song, Zhigang","Zeng, Yigang","Shen, Yinzhong","Shi, Yuxin","Zhu, Tongyu","Lu, Hongzhou"],"date":"2020-03-16T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32171869","source":"PubMed","week":"202012|Mar 16 - Mar 22","doi":"10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.004","keywords":["covid-19","clinical characteristics","clinical progression","sars-cov-2","viral clearance"],"locations":["Shanghai","Shanghai","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Mechanism"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138490615627776,"score":204.8392}]}
