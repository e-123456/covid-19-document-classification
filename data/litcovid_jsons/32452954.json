SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: COVID-19 emergency shocked national health systems, subtracting resources from treatment of other diseases. Its impact on surgical oncology is still to elucidate. METHODS: A 56-question survey regarding the oncological surgical activity in Italy during the COVID-19 emergency was sent to referral centers for hepato-bilio-pancreatic, colorectal, esophago-gastric, and sarcoma/soft-tissue tumors. The survey portrays the situation 5 weeks after the first case of secondary transmission in Italy. RESULTS: In total, 54 surgical Units in 36 Hospitals completed the survey (95%). After COVID-19 emergency, 70% of Units had reduction of hospital beds (median -50%) and 76% of surgical activity (median -50%). The number of surgical procedures decreased: 3.8 (interquartile range 2.7-5.4) per week before the emergency versus 2.6 (22-4.4) after (P = 0.036). In Lombardy, the most involved district, the number decreased from 3.9 to 2 procedures per week. The time interval between multidisciplinary discussion and surgery more than doubled: 7 (6-10) versus 3 (3-4) weeks (P < 0.001). Two-third (n = 34) of departments had repeat multidisciplinary discussion of patients. The commonest criteria to prioritize surgery were tumor biology (80%), time interval from neoadjuvant therapy (61%), risk of becoming unresectable (57%), and tumor-related symptoms (52%). Oncological hub-and-spoke program was planned in 29 departments, but was active only in 10 (19%). CONCLUSIONS: This survey showed how surgical oncology suffered remarkable reduction of the activity resulting in doubled waiting-list. The oncological hub-and-spoke program did not work adequately. The reassessment of healthcare systems to better protect the oncological path seems a priority.","Ann Surg","Torzilli, Guido","Vigano, Luca","Galvanin, Jacopo","Castoro, Carlo","Quagliuolo, Vittorio","Spinelli, Antonino","Zerbi, Alessandro","Donadon, Matteo","Montorsi, Marco","32452954"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of COVID-19 emergency on elective oncological surgical activity in Italy.
