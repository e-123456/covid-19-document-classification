The objective of this work is to investigate the action plan on breastfeeding in postpartum women with SARS-CoV-2 and her newborn. METHODS: A literature search has been conducted through the Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, BVS, and Cuiden databases. The methodological quality of the articles has been assessed using the \"Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation\" (GRADE). This study has not been registered in PROSPERO. RESULTS: A total of 14 documents have been found, of which 9 are observational empirical studies. Most of the studies were conducted in China, Italy, the USA, and Australia. A total of 114 mothers infected with coronavirus with their respective newborns have been assessed. The analyzed investigations state that it is best for the newborn to be breastfed; given that mother's milk samples were analyzed, detecting the presence of antibodies of the coronavirus in them, being a protective factor against infection. CONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding in postpartum women with SARS-CoV-2 is highly recommended for the newborn, if the health of the mother and newborn allow it. When direct breastfeeding is favoured, the appropriate respiratory hygiene measures always have to be considered. Whether the mother's health does not permit direct breastfeeding, her breast milk should be previously extracted and kept unpasteurized. To secure the newborn feeding, milk banks are also an appropriate option.","Rev Esp Salud Publica","Fernandez-Carrasco, Francisco Javier","Vazquez-Lara, Juana Maria","Gonzalez-Mey, Urbano","Gomez-Salgado, Juan","Parron-Carreno, Tesifon","Rodriguez-Diaz, Luciano","32458823"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus disease is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus, considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) an international public health emergency that may have negative consequences during breastfeeding.
