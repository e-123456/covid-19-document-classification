We describe a 16-year old male and a 64-year old female recently lung transplanted patients with COVID-19 during inpatient rehabilitation. Both patients were on triple immunosuppressive therapy and had no signs of allograft dysfunction. Both patients had close contact to a person who developed COVID-19 and were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently, both patients underwent systematic screening and SARS-CoV-2 was detected ultimately. While the 16-year old boy was completely asymptomatic, the 64-year old woman developed only mild COVID-19. Immunosuppressive therapy was unchanged and no experimental treatment was initiated. No signs of graft involvement or dysfunction were noticed.
