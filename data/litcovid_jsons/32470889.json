All efforts to contain the pathogenesis either using inhibitory drugs or vaccines largelyremained futile due to a lack of better understanding of the genomic feature of this virus. In thepresent study, we compared the 2019-nCoV with other coronaviruses, which indicated that batSARS like coronavirus could be a probable ancestor of the novel coronavirus. The proteinsequence similarity of pangolin-hCoV and bat-hCoV with human coronavirus was higher ascompared to their nucleotide similarity denoting the occurrence of more synonymous mutationsin the genome. Phylogenetic and alignment analysis of 591 novel coronaviruses of differentclades from Group I to Group V revealed several mutations and concomitant amino acidchanges. Detailed investigation on nucleotide substitution unfolded 100 substitutions in thecoding region of which 43 were synonymous and 57 were of non-synonymous type.

Until now, the intermediate host and mechanisms of interspecies jump of this virus are unknown. METHODS: Phylogenetic analysis of all available bat coronavirus (CoV) complete genomes was performed in order to analyze the relationships between bat CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In order to suggest a possible intermediate host, another phylogenetic reconstruction of CoV genomes obtained from animals which were hypothetically commercialized in the Chinese markets was also carried out. Moreover, mutation analysis was executed to suggest genomic regions which may have permitted the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host. RESULTS: The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 formed a cluster with the bat CoV isolate RaTG13. Possible CoV interspecies jumps among bat isolates were also observed. The phylogenetic tree reconstructed from CoV strains belonging to different animals demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2, bat RaTG13 and pangolin CoV genomes formed a monophyletic cluster, demonstrating that pangolins may be suggested as SARS-CoV-2 intermediate hosts. Three AA substitutions localized in the S1 portion of the S gene were observed, some of which have been correlated to structural modifications of the S protein which may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 tropism to human cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows the tight relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARS-like strains. It also hypothesizes that pangolins might have been possible intermediate hosts of the infection.
