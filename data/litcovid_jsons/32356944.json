During an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 with community transmission, our institution utilized an integrated strategy for early detection and containment of COVID-19 amongst healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: Our institution utilized a strategy comprising three key components: enforcing reporting of HCWs with acute respiratory illness (ARI) to our institution's Staff Clinic for monitoring; conducting ongoing syndromic surveillance to obtain early warning of potential clusters of COVID-19, and outbreak investigation and management. RESULTS: Over a 16-week surveillance period, our institution detected 14 cases of COVID-19 amongst HCWs with ARI symptoms. 2 of the cases were linked epidemiologically and thus constituted a COVID-19 cluster with HCW-HCW transmission occurring intra-hospital; we also detected one family cluster and two clusters amongst HCWs who shared accommodation. Through early intervention, our institution contained all detected cases of COVID-19, with no onward transmission to HCWs or patients after containment measures were instituted. Early detection minimized the number of HCWs requiring quarantine, hence preserving business continuity during an ongoing pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: An integrated strategy of surveillance, outbreak management and encouraging individual responsibility was successful in detecting clusters of COVID-19 infection amongst HCWs early. With ongoing local transmission, vigilance must be maintained for intra-hospital spread in non-clinical areas, where social mingling of HCWs occurs. As most individuals with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, addressing presenteeism is crucial to minimize potentially exposed staff and patients.","Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol","Wee, Liang En","Sim, Jean Xiang Ying","Conceicao, Edwin Philip","Aung, May Kyawt","Goh, Jia Qing","Yeo, Dennis Wu Ting","Gan, Wee Hoe","Chua, Ying Ying","Wijaya, Limin","Tan, Thuan Tong","Tan, Ban Hock","Ling, Moi Lin","Venkatachalam, Indumathi","32391746"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: Staff surveillance is crucial during the containment phase of a pandemic, to help reduce potential healthcare-associated transmission as well as sustaining good staff morale.
