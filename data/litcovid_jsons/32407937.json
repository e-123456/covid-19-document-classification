Biomarkers were screened out of hematological parameters for risk stratification. METHOD: Confirmed COVID-19 adult patients in Suzhou were included. The patient data was collected, and the results of laboratory examinations were compared between the mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 groups. A ROC was calculated to compare the diagnostic performance of candidate indexes, and dynamic levels of hematological indexes were compared between the two groups. RESULT: 75 patients were enrolled, with a mean age of 46.6+/-14years, and 45 patients were male. All patients were classified into two groups: the mild/moderate group and the severe group. WBC, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels of the severe group were significantly higher (P<0.05) than the mild/moderate, and the lymphocyte was lower. The ROC test showed that the hematological parameters had a larger AUC than that of inflammatory factors. There was a significant difference in lymphocyte and fibrinogen levels between the two groups on day 1 (P<0.05). However, NLR of the severe group was higher than the mild/moderate on days 1, 4 and 14 (P<0.01), and so was D-dimer on days 1, 7 and 14 (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The common COVID-19 abnormal hematological indexes on admission included hyperfibrinogenemia, lymphopenia, the elevation of D-dimer, and leukopenia, which were significantly different between the mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 groups. Furthermore, the dynamic change of NLR and D-dimer level can distinguish severe COVID-19 cases from the mild/moderate.","Thromb Res","Fu, Jianhong","Kong, Jindan","Wang, Wei","Wu, Meiying","Yao, Lin","Wang, Zhaoyue","Jin, Jun","Wu, Depei","Yu, Xin","32407937"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features of COVID-19 cases in Suzhou China.

METHODS: A cohort of patients with covid-19 admitted to the Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University from January 11, 2020 to March 3, 2020 was retrospectively analyzed. Patients with hematologic malignancy were excluded. The NLR was calculated by dividing the neutrophil count by the lymphocyte count. NLR values were measured at the time of admission. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. A multivariate logistic analysis was performed. RESULTS: 1004 patients with covid-19 were included in this study. The mortality rate was 4.0% (40 cases). The median age of nonsurvivors (68 years) was significantly older than survivors (62 years). Male sex was more predominant in nonsurvival group (27; 67.5%) than in the survival group (466; 48.3%). NLR value of nonsurvival group (median 49.06, IQR 25.71-69.70) was higher than that of survival group (median 4.11, IQR 2.44-8.12, P < 0.001).
