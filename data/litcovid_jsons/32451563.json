The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (21.1%, 95% CI: 13.0-27.2%) and diabetes (9.7%, 95% CI: 7.2-12.2%), followed by cardiovascular disease (8.4%, 95% CI: 3.8-13.8%) and respiratory system disease (1.5%, 95% CI: 0.9-2.1%). When compared between severe and non-severe patients, the pooled OR of hypertension, respiratory system disease, and cardiovascular disease were 2.36 (95% CI: 1.46-3.83), 2.46 (95% CI: 1.76-3.44) and 3.42 (95% CI: 1.88-6.22) respectively. CONCLUSION: We assessed the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 patients and found that underlying disease, including hypertension, respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease, may be risk factors for severe patients compared with non-severe patients."],"journal":"Int J Infect Dis","authors":["Yang, Jing","Zheng, Ya","Gou, Xi","Pu, Ke","Chen, Zhaofeng","Guo, Qinghong","Ji, Rui","Wang, Haojia","Wang, Yuping","Zhou, Yongning"],"date":"2020-03-17T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32173574","source":"PubMed","week":"202012|Mar 16 - Mar 22","doi":"10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.017","keywords":["covid-19","clinical characteristics","comorbidities","epidemiology","meta-analysis","sars-cov-2"],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"weight":0,"_version_":1666138492594290689,"score":241.67862}]}
