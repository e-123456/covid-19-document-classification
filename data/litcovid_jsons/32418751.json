Currently, data on changes in sexual behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak are limited. AIM: The present study aimed to obtain a preliminary understanding of the changes in people's sexual behavior, as a result of the pandemic, and explore the context in which they manifest. METHODS: A convenience sample of 270 men and 189 women who completed an online survey consisting of 12 items plus an additional question were included in the study. OUTCOMES: The study outcomes were obtained using a study-specific questionnaire to assess the changes in people's sexual behavior. RESULTS: While there was a wide range of individual responses, our results showed that 44% of participants reported a decrease in the number of sexual partners and about 37% of participants reported a decrease in sexual frequency. Multiple regression analysis showed that age, partner relationship, and sexual desire were closely related to sexual frequency. In addition, we found that most individuals with risky sexual experiences had a rapid reduction in risky sexual behavior. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The current findings contribute to identifying another potential health implication associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and report preliminary evidence of the need to provide potential interventions for the population. STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: This study is the first to perform a preliminary exploration of sexual behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak. The generalizability of the results is limited, given that only a small convenience sample was used. CONCLUSION: During the height of the COVID-19 outbreak, overall sexual activity, frequency, and risky behaviors declined significantly among young men and women in China. Li W, Li G, Xin C, et al.

Methods: This paper presents pre-planned interim analyses of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study, administered through an online survey. Outcomes: Sexual activity was measured using the following question: \"On average after self-isolating how many times have you engaged in sexual activity weekly?\" Demographic and clinical data was collected, including sex, age, marital status, employment, annual household income, region, current smoking status, current alcohol consumption, number of chronic physical conditions, number of chronic psychiatric conditions, any physical symptom experienced during self-isolation, and number of days of self-isolation. The association between several factors (independent variables) and sexual activity (dependent variable) was studied using a multivariable logistic regression model. Results: 868 individuals were included in this study. There were 63.1% of women, and 21.8% of adults who were aged between 25 and 34 years. During self-isolation, 39.9% of the population reported engaging in sexual activity at least once per week. Variables significantly associated with sexual activity (dependent variable) were being male, a younger age, being married or in a domestic partnership, consuming alcohol, and a higher number of days of self-isolation/social distancing.

However, worry, which is a key motivator of behavioral health changes, occurs less frequently for older than younger adults, and less frequently for men than women.

METHODS: From March 23-31, 2020, we administered an online questionnaire assessing COVID-19 perceptions, worries, and behavior changes. Participants were a convenience sample of United States residents, who were community-dwelling younger adults (18-35) or older adults (65 to 81). Analyses included 146 younger adults (68 men, 78 women) and 156 older adults (82 men, 74 women). Participants was predominately White, living in suburban/urban areas, and had completed some college. RESULTS: During the early phase of the outbreak in the United States, older adults perceived the risks of COVID-19 to be higher than did younger adults. Despite this, older men were comparatively less worried about COVID-19 than their younger counterparts. Compared to the other participants, older men had also implemented the fewest behavior changes.
