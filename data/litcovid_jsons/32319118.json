There is evidence that older age and several comorbidities can affect the risk to develop severe pneumonia and possibly the need of mechanic ventilation in subjects infected with SARS-Cov2. Therefore, we evaluated the outcome of SARS-Cov2 infection in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) such as X linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). METHODS: When the SARS-Cov2 epidemic has reached Italy, we have activated a surveillance protocol of patients with IEI, to perform SARS-Cov2 search by nasopharyngeal swab in patients presenting with symptoms which could be a manifestations of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, diarrhea or vomiting. RESULTS: We describe two patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) of 34 and 26 years of age with complete absence of B cells from peripheral blood who developed COVID-19, as diagnosed by SARS-Cov-2 detection by nasopharyngeal swab, while receiving immunoglobulin infusions. Both patients developed interstitial pneumonia characterized by fever, cough and anorexia and associated with elevation of CRP and ferritin, but have never required oxygen ventilation or intensive care. CONCLUSION: Our report suggests that XLA patients might present high risk to develop pneumonia after SARS-Cov2 infection, but can recover from infection, suggesting that B cell response might be important, but not strictly required to overcome the disease. However, there is need of larger observational studies to extend these conclusions to other patients with similar genetic immune defects.","Pediatr Allergy Immunol","Soresina, Annarosa","Moratto, Daniele","Chiarini, Marco","Paolillo, Ciro","Baresi, Giulia","Foca, Emanuele","Bezzi, Michela","Baronio, Barbara","Giacomelli, Mauro","Badolato, Raffaele","32319118"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: The recent SARS-Cov2 pandemic, which has recently affected Italy since February 21, constitutes a threat for normal subjects, as the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID19) can manifest with a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes ranging from asymptomatic cases to pneumonia or even death.

Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. METHODS: In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. FINDINGS: Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 59.7 (SD 13.3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (61.5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3-11) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64.6 years [11.2] vs 51.9 years [12.9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13.5%) patients. INTERPRETATION: The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.
