METHODS: We performed an internet-based survey among Presidents and Members of the Societies of the Latin American Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (FLANC). We blindly analyzed information about local conditions and their impact on neurosurgical praxis using SPSS(R) software. RESULTS: Information came from 21 countries. Sixteen Society Presidents reported having suspended regular activities, and differing local scheduled congresses, fourteen reported mandatory isolation by government, and four instituted a telemedicine project. Four-hundred eighty-six colleagues, mean age 49 years, reported a mean 79% reduction in their neurosurgical praxis. Seventy-six percent of neurosurgeons had savings to self-support for 3-6 months, if restrictions are long lasting. CONCLUSIONS: Stopping activities among Societies of the FLANC, together with a drop of 79% of neurosurgical praxis, adds to deficits in provider s protection equipment and increasing demand for attention in the healthcare systems; representing a huge financial risk for their sustainability.
