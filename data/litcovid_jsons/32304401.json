Consequently, multiple federal and state governments have placed restrictions on hospitals such as limiting \"elective surgery\" and recommending social or physical distancing. We review the literature on several areas that have been affected including surgical selection, inpatient care, and physician well-being. These areas affecting inpatient paradigms include surgical priority, physical or social distancing, file sharing for online clinical communications, and physician wellness. During this crisis, it is important that orthopaedic departments place an emphasis on personnel safety and slowing the spread of the virus, so that the department can still maintain vital functions. Physical Distancing and emerging technologies such as inpatient telemedicine and online file sharing applications can enable orthopaedic programs to still function, while attempting to protect medical staff and patients from COVID-19 spread. This literature review sought to provide evidence-based guidance to orthopaedic departments during an unprecedented time.
