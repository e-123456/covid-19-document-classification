To date, data are limited regarding the trend of liver biochemistries over the course of illness. We aimed to evaluate the trend, etiology, and outcomes associated with liver biochemistries in COVID-19. A total of 60 patients with COVID-19 were admitted between March 21 and March 28, 2020. Mean age was 57 years, 65% were male and 28% were Hispanic. At study conclusion, 6 patients were deceased, 28 discharged, and 26 remained admitted. Patients who remained admitted were followed for median 12 days. Of 60 patients, 41 (69%) had at least one abnormal liver biochemistry on admission. Median aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was higher than alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at admission (46 vs. 30 U/L) and during the hospital course. Aminotransferases rose above normal in 54 (93%) patients, while alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin elevations were rare. Ten (17%) patients developed aminotransferases more than 5 times the upper limit of normal. AST highly correlated with ALT throughout the illness course (r = 0.97; P < 0.0001), whereas correlations with markers of muscle injury and inflammation were weak. Statin use was common prior to (40%) and during admission (80%) at our center, with no difference in peak liver biochemistries between users and non-users. No demographic or comorbid illness was associated with liver injury. Admission AST (69 vs. 49; P < 0.05), peak AST (364 vs. 77; P = 0.003), and peak ALT (220 vs. 52; P = 0.002) were higher in intubated patients. Conclusion: AST-dominant aminotransferase elevation is common in COVID-19, mirrors disease severity, and appears to reflect true hepatic injury.","Hepatology","Bloom, Patricia P","Meyerowitz, Eric A","Reinus, Zoe","Daidone, Michael","Gustafson, Jenna","Kim, Arthur Y","Schaefer, Esperance","Chung, Raymond T","32415860"],"abstract":["Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leads to elevated liver biochemistries in approximately half of patients on presentation.
