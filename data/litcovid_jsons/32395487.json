We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 outside of Wuhan city; and to develop a multivariate model to predict the risk of prolonged length of stay in hospital (ProLOS). Methods: The study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Zhejiang province from January to February 20, 2020. Medical records of all confirmed cases of COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were categorized into the ProLOS and non-ProLOS groups by hospital length of stay greater and less than 14 days, respectively. Conventional descriptive statistics were applied. Multivariate regression model was built to predict the risk of ProLOS, with variables selected using stepwise approach. Results: A total of 75 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included for quantitative analysis, including 25 (33%) patients in the ProLOS group. ProLOS patients were more likely to have history of traveling to Wuhan (68% vs. 28%; P=0.002). Patients in the ProLOS group showed lower neutrophil counts [median (IQR): 2.50 (1.77-3.23) x10(9)/L vs. 2.90 (2.21-4.19) x10(9)/L; P=0.048], higher partial thrombin time (PT) (13.42+/-0.63 vs. 13.10+/-0.48 s; P=0.029), lower D-Dimer [0.26 (0.22-0.46) vs. 0.44 (0.32-0.84) mg/L; P=0.012]. There was no patient died and no severe case in our cohort. The overall LOS was 11 days (IQR, 5-15 days). The median cost for a hospital stay was 7,388.19 RMB (IQR, 5,085.39-11,145.44). The prediction model included five variables of procalcitonin, heart rate, epidemiological history, lymphocyte count and cough. The discrimination of the model was 84.8% (95% CI: 75.3% to 94.4%).

However, the clinical characteristics of patients in other areas around Wuhan, Hubei Province are still unclear. In this study, we performed epidemiological and clinical characteristics analysis on these regional cases. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated COVID-19 patients positively confirmed by nucleic acid Q-PCR at Taihe Hospital from January 16 to February 4, 2020. Their epidemiological, clinical manifestations, and imaging characteristics were analysed. RESULTS: Among the 73 patients studied, 12.3% developed symptoms after returning to Shiyan from Wuhan, and 71.2% had a history of close contact with Wuhan personnel or confirmed cases. Among these patients, 9 cases were associated with family clustering. The first main symptoms presented by these patients were fever (84.9%) and cough (21.9%). The longest incubation period was 26 days, and the median interval from the first symptoms to admission was 5 days. Of the patients, 67.1% were originally healthy people with no underlying diseases, others mostly had common comorbidities including hypertension (12.3%) and diabetes (5.5%), 10.9% were current smokers, 30.1% had low white blood cell counts and 45.2% showed decreased lymphocytes at the first time of diagnosis. CT scans showed that multiple patchy ground glass shadows outside of the patient lungs were commonly observed, and a single sub-pleural sheet of ground glass shadow with enhanced vascular bundles was also found located under the pleura. Patient follow-up to February 14 presented 38.4% severe cases and 2.7% critical cases.

CONCLUSION: The epidemiological characteristics of patients in the area around Wuhan, such as Shiyan, at first diagnosis are described as follows: Patients had histories of Wuhan residences in the early stage and family clustering in the later period. The incubation period was relatively long, and the incidence was relatively hidden, but the virulence was relatively low. The initial diagnosis of the patients was mostly ordinary, and the percentage of critical patients who evolved into the ICU during follow-up is 2.7%, which is lower than the 26.1% reported by Wuhan city.

Diabetes could be one of the risk factors for progression to severe/critical outcomes. No evidence exists that smoking protects COVID-19 patients from developing to severe/critical cases, and the absolute number of lymphocytes at initial diagnosis could not predict the progression risk from severe to critical condition.

Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to build a prediction model incorporating the selected features. The performance of the nomogram regarding the C-index, calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness was assessed. Internal validation was assessed by bootstrapping. RESULTS: The median age of the cohort was 43 years. Severe patients were older than mild patients by a median of 6 years. Fever, cough, and dyspnea were more common in severe patients. The individualized prediction nomogram included seven predictors: body temperature at admission, cough, dyspnea, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic liver disease, and chronic kidney disease. The model had good discrimination with an area under the curve of 0.862, C-index of 0.863 (95% confidence interval, 0.801-0.925), and good calibration. A high C-index value of 0.839 was reached in the interval validation. Decision curve analysis showed that the prediction nomogram was clinically useful. CONCLUSION: We established an early warning model incorporating clinical characteristics that could be quickly obtained on admission. This model can be used to help predict severe COVID-19 and identify patients at risk of developing severe disease."],"journal":"PLoS One","authors":["Zhou, Yiwu","He, Yanqi","Yang, Huan","Yu, He","Wang, Ting","Chen, Zhu","Yao, Rong","Liang, Zongan"],"date":"2020-05-19T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32421703","source":"PubMed","week":"202021|May 18 - May 24","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0233328","locations":["Wuhan","Sichuan","Sichuan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Treatment","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1667159284462387201,"score":174.477}]}
