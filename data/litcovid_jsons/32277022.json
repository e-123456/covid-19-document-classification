To meet diagnostic needs as the pandemic grows, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently granted several commercial SARS-CoV-2 tests Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), but manufacturer-independent evaluation data are scarce. We performed the first manufacturer-independent evaluation of the fully automated sample-to-result two-target test cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 (cobas) (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ), which received US FDA EUA on March 12, 2020. The comparator was a standardized 3-hour SARS-CoV-2 protocol, consisting of RNA extraction using an automated portable instrument, followed by a two-target RT-PCR, which our laboratory has routinely used since January 2020 (Corman VM et al. EuroSurveill 25 (3):2000045). Cobas and the comparator showed overall agreement of 98.1% and a kappa value of 0.95 on an in-house validation panel consisting of 217 well-characterized retrospective samples. Immediate prospective head-to-head comparative evaluation followed on 502 samples, and the diagnostic approaches showed overall percent agreement of 99.6% and a kappa value of 0.98. A good correlation (r (2) = 0.96) between cycle threshold values for SARS-CoV-2 specific targets obtained by cobas and the comparator was observed. Our results showed that cobas is a reliable assay for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples collected in the UTM-RT system. Under the extraordinary circumstances that laboratories are facing worldwide, a safe diagnostic platform switch is feasible in only 48 hours and in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic if carefully planned and executed.","J Clin Microbiol","Poljak, Mario","Korva, Misa","Knap Gasper, Natasa","Fujs Komlos, Kristina","Sagadin, Martin","Ursic, Tina","Avsic Zupanc, Tatjana","Petrovec, Miroslav","32277022"],"abstract":["Laboratories are currently witnessing extraordinary demand globally for sampling devices, reagents, consumables, and diagnostic instruments needed for timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
