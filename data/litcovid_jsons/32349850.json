This study aimed to review and synthesise learning from previous literature focused on the impact on grief and bereavement during other infectious disease outbreaks. We conducted a rapid scoping review according to the principles of the Joanna Briggs Institute and analysed qualitative data using thematic synthesis. From the 218 identified papers, 6 were included in the analysis. They were four qualitative studies, one observational study and a systematic review. Studies were conducted in West Africa, Haiti and Singapore. No research studies have focused on outcomes and support for bereaved people during a pandemic. Studies have tended to focus on survivors i.e. those who had the illness and recovered, recognising that some of these individuals will also be bereaved people. Previous pandemics appear to cause multiple losses both directly related to death itself but also in terms of disruption to social norms, rituals and mourning practices. This affects the ability for an individual to connect with the deceased both before and after the death, potentially increasing the risk of complicated grief. In view of the limited research, specific learning from the current COVID-19 crisis and the impact on the bereaved would be pertinent. Current focus should include innovative ways to promote connection and adapt rituals while maintaining respect. Strong leadership and coordination between different bereavement organisations is essential to providing successful post-bereavement support.","J Pain Symptom Manage","Mayland, Catriona R","Harding, Andrew Je","Preston, Nancy","Payne, Sheila","32416233"],"abstract":["The global COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a major impact on the experience of death, dying and bereavement.
