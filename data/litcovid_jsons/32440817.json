In this study, the changes in clinical practice occurred in an orthopaedic center in Milan are described. METHODS: Number and type of admissions, outpatients cancelled and preserved, emergency room, and intensive care unit activities have been analyzed in the timeframe of seven weeks since the beginning of the pandemic (from February 24th to April 10th) and compared with the same period in 2019. RESULTS: The planned surgical admissions declined from 2172 in 2019 to 664 in 2020 (69.42%, p < 0.0001), while emergencies increased from 158 to 268 (69.62%).

The experience for an Orthopaedic Surgeon in New York or Madrid may differ from that of an Orthopaedic Surgeon in Singapore, or South Korea. As Europe is, at least at the moment, the most affected continent, it hopefully is an interesting topic for all of you. The Covid-19 pandemic is affecting all aspects of our lives, therefore this editorial is divided into 4 sessions: Role as surgeon, as doctor, as teacher, and as family member. Most countries have stopped elective surgeries and by that relegated Orthopaedic surgeons to a minimum of work. Keeping contact to patients with digital tools might be an option to achieve an organised restart after the end of the lock down period and to keep treating patients through that phase. For many Orthopaedic surgeons, the principal task now is being part of an interdisciplinary team that is headed by colleagues from Internal Medicine or Anaesthesiology. Wards from the Orthopaedic department are reorganised as quarantine wards for Covid-19 patients. Worldwide all conferences have been cancelled and nobody knows for how long this will continue. Education now has become fully digital, allowing to present and communicate without real limitations compared to conventional conferences. Some teaching options, such as hands-on workshops, fellowships, etc. are ceased and cannot be replaced by digital options.
