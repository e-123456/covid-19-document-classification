We compiled a daily dataset including confirmed case counts, ambient temperature (AT), diurnal temperature range (DTR), absolute humidity (AH) and migration scale index (MSI) for each city during the period of January 20th to March 2nd, 2020. First, we explored the associations between COVID-19 confirmed case counts, meteorological factors, and MSI using non-linear regression.

In the first stage, generalized linear models with negative binomial distribution were fitted to estimate city-specific effects of meteorological factors on confirmed case counts. In the second stage, the meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled effects. Our results showed that among 13 cities that have less than 50 confirmed cases, 9 cities locate in the Northern China with average AT below 0 degrees C, 12 cities had average AH below 4 g/m(3), and one city (Haikou) had the highest AH (14.05 g/m(3)). Those 17 cities with 50 and more cases accounted for 90.6% of all cases in our study.

Infoveillance approaches using social media can help characterize disease distribution and public knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors critical to the early stages of an outbreak. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a quantitative and qualitative assessment of Chinese social media posts originating in Wuhan City on the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Chinese-language messages from Wuhan were collected for 39 days between December 23, 2019-January 30, 2020 on Weibo. For quantitative analysis, the total daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan were obtained from the Chinese National Health Commission and regression was used to fit a linear model to determine if Weibo COVID-19 posts were predictive of the number of cases reported. Qualitative content analysis used and inductive manual coding approach to identify parent classifications of news and user generated COVID-19 topics. RESULTS: 115,299 Weibo posts were collected during the study time frame consisting of an average of 2,956 posts per day (min 0; max 13,587). Quantitative analysis found a positive correlation between the number of Weibo posts and number of reported cases from Wuhan, with approximately 10 more COVID-19 cases per 40 social media posts (p < 0.001). This effect size was also larger than what was observed for the rest of China excluding Hubei provenance (where Wuhan is the capital city) and also held when comparing the number of Weibo posts to the incidence proportion of cases in Hubei province. Qualitative analysis of 11,893 posts during the first 21-days of the study period uncovered four parent classifications including Weibo discussions about the causative agent of the disease, changing epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak, and public reaction to outbreak control and response measures. Generally, these themes also exhibited public uncertainty and changing knowledge and attitudes about COVID-19, including posts exhibiting both protective and higher-risk behavior.

There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to their clinical characteristics.

The aggravation group had1 patient (20.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 3 (60.0%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 1 (20.0%) with normal chest CT; meanwhile, the nonaggravation group had 3 patients (25.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 5 (41.7%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 4 (33.3%) with normal chest CT. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups. In the aggravation group, the total lymphocyte counts significantly decreased in comparison to that in the non-aggravation group.
