A higher proportion of newborns was severely ill (12%) and dyspnea was the most common reported sign (40%).Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 affects children less severely than adults. Laboratory and radiology findings are mainly nonspecific. Larger epidemiological and clinical cohort studies are needed to better understand possible implications of COVID-19 infection in children.What is Known:* A novel Coronavirus has been recently identified as responsible for a new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) spreading globally.* There is limited evidence on SARS-CoV2 infection in children.What is New:* Systematically reviewed available evidence showed that children with SARS-CoV-2 infection may have a less severe pattern of disease in comparison to adults.* Blood tests and radiology findings are mainly nonspecific in children but may help to identify those who are severely ill."],"journal":"Eur J Pediatr","authors":["Liguoro, Ilaria","Pilotto, Chiara","Bonanni, Margherita","Ferrari, Maria Elena","Pusiol, Anna","Nocerino, Agostino","Vidal, Enrico","Cogo, Paola"],"date":"2020-05-20T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32424745","source":"PubMed","week":"202021|May 18 - May 24","doi":"10.1007/s00431-020-03684-7","keywords":["covid-19","infectious disease","neonatal","novel coronavirus","pandemic","pediatrics"],"topics":["Treatment","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1667352728700977152,"score":235.51784}]}
