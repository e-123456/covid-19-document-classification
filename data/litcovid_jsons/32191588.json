Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with the calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (R2=0.25), p<0.001). Based on quartiles of patients from day 0 to day 26 involvement, 4 stages of lung CT were defined: Stage 1 (0-4 days): ground glass opacities (GGO) in 18/24 (75%) patients with the total CT score of 2+/-2; (2)Stage-2 (5-8d days): increased crazy-paving pattern 9/17 patients (53%) with a increase in total CT score (6+/-4, p=0.002); (3) Stage-3 (9-13days): consolidation 19/21 (91%) patients with the peak of total CT score (7+/-4); (4) Stage-4 (>/=14 days): gradual resolution of consolidation 15/20 (75%) patients with a decreased total CT score (6+/-4) without crazy-paving pattern. Conclusion In patients recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia (without severe respiratory distress during the disease course), lung abnormalities on chest CT showed greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms."],"journal":"Radiology","authors":["Pan, Feng","Ye, Tianhe","Sun, Peng","Gui, Shan","Liang, Bo","Li, Lingli","Zheng, Dandan","Wang, Jiazheng","Hesketh, Richard L","Yang, Lian","Zheng, Chuansheng"],"date":"2020-02-14T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32053470","week":"20207|Feb 10 - Feb 16","doi":"10.1148/radiol.2020200370","source":"PubMed","locations":["Pneumonia"],"topics":["Mechanism"],"weight":1,"_version_":1661359647260409857,"score":198.87402}]}
