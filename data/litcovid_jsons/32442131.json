The transmissibility of coronavirus from asymptomatic patients to healthy individuals has received enormous attention. An important study using the COVID-19 data from the city Ningbo, China, was carried out to estimate and compare the transmission rates of the coronavirus by the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. However, in the original analysis, the usual chi-squared tests were unduly used for some contingency tables with small cell counts including zero, which may violate the assumptions for the chi-squared test. OBJECTIVE: We reanalyze the data from the city Ningbo with more appropriate statistical methods to draw more reliable and sound conclusions on the transmission rates of the coronavirus by the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. METHODS: We exclude the cases associated with the super-spreader and adopt more appropriate statistical methods, including the permutation test and Fisher's exact test, to reanalyze the COVID-19 data from the city Ningbo. RESULTS: After excluding the cases related to the super-spreader, Fisher's exact test yields p-value=.84, which indicates stronger evidence of no difference in the transmission rates compared with the original analysis. The odds ratio of transmission rates of coronavirus between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients is 1.2 with a 95% confidence interval [0.5, 2.8].

METHODS: We retrospectively retrieved data for paediatric patients (aged 0-16 years) with confirmed COVID-19 from electronic medical records in three hospitals in Zhejiang, China. We recorded patients' epidemiological and clinical features. FINDINGS: From Jan 17 to March 1, 2020, 36 children (mean age 8.3 [SD 3.5] years) were identified to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The route of transmission was by close contact with family members (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to the epidemic area (12 [33%]); eight (22%) patients had both exposures. 19 (53%) patients had moderate clinical type with pneumonia; 17 (47%) had mild clinical type and either were asymptomatic (ten [28%]) or had acute upper respiratory symptoms (seven [19%]). Common symptoms on admission were fever (13 [36%]) and dry cough (seven [19%]). Of those with fever, four (11%) had a body temperature of 38.5 degrees C or higher, and nine (25%) had a body temperature of 37.5-38.5 degrees C. Typical abnormal laboratory findings were elevated creatine kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and elevated procalcitonin (six [17%]). Besides radiographic presentations, variables that were associated significantly with severity of COVID-19 were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase MB.
