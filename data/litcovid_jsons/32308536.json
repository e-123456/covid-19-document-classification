All four cases were likely to have contracted the virus in China. The children had no symptoms or mild flu-like illness. The cases were managed symptomatically. None required antiviral therapy.

Secondly, oropharyngeal and nasal swabs in children were at risk of false negative results. These issues have implications for infection control.
