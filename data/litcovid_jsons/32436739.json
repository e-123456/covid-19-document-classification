Information how to manage contraception in different conditions is presented.Results: Women may, in general, continue to use either intrauterine and or hormonal contraceptives. The use of condom should be added to any hormonal contraceptive, when the contraceptive efficacy is reduced or when women stop the contraceptive method.Conclusion: At the present time, during the Coronavirus-Covid 19 pandemia, no data contraindicate the use of intrauterine or hormonal contraceptives.

Results: Estrogens stimulate the humoral response to viral infections, while testosterone and progesterone give an immune suppression of both innate and cell-mediated immune responses.

METHODS: An observational study using data from a previous study conducted prior to the pandemic. We compared frequency of sexual intercourse, desire for pregnancy, Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score, contraception type, and menstrual abnormalities among women during the pandemic with 6-12 months prior to the pandemic. Participants were contacted by telephone for questioning. RESULTS: Average frequency of sexual intercourse was significantly increased during the pandemic compared with 6-12 months prior (2.4 vs 1.9, P=0.001). Before the pandemic 19 (32.7%) participants desired to become pregnant, whereas during the pandemic it had decreased to 3 (5.1%) (P=0.001). Conversely, use of contraception during the pandemic significantly decreased among participants compared with prior (24 vs 10, P=0.004). Menstrual disorders were more common during the pandemic than before (27.6% vs 12.1%, P=0.008). Participants had significantly better FSFI scores before the pandemic compared with scores during the pandemic (20.52 vs 17.56, P=0.001). CONCLUSION: Sexual desire and frequency of intercourse significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas quality of sexual life significantly decreased.
