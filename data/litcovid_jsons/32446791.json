Responding to medical emergencies in patients with suspected COVID-19 will require new guidelines and protocols. Simulation can support their development. METHODS: We organised seven simulations involving patients with suspected COVID-19 for staff at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals. Participants completed pre- and post-simulation questionnaires. RESULTS: Fifty-six staff participated and they reported being significantly less prepared to respond to an emergency in a patient with suspected COVID-19 than in one in whom it is not suspected. The simulations significantly improved the participants' confidence in responding to emergencies in patients with suspected COVID-19. Numerous challenges were identified along the themes of equipment, personnel, communication and procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Low-fidelity simulation can provide relevant and timely information on how prepared health systems and their workforce are to respond to emergencies. We urge NHS trusts nationally to implement simulations to identify problems and develop effective solutions.","Clin Med (Lond)","Wenlock, Rhys D","Arnold, Amy","Patel, Hiten","Kirtchuk, David","32430344"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: COVID-19 poses many challenges to healthcare systems and workers.

We present the management of a patient with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia. Case: A 66-years-old man presented to the hospital and his recent travel history, infective symptoms and CXR made him a possible COVID-19 suspect. Emergency surgery was decided considering the septic condition. The patient was transported to operating theatre with supplemental oxygen over a face mask and plastic covering over the trolley. Rapid sequence intubation was performed by an experienced anesthetist using a videolaryngoscope. After surgery, the patient remained intubated to avoid re-intubation due to initial presentation of respiratory distress. Droplet, contact and airborne infection precautions were instituted. Conclusions: Our objective was to facilitate surgical management of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 while minimising risk of nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers and other patients.","Korean J Anesthesiol","Yek, Jia Lin Jacklyn","Kiew, Sca","Ngu, J C","Lim, Jgc","32434289"],"abstract":["Background: As the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic spreads globally, hospitals are rushing to adapt their facilities which may not have been designed to deal with infections adequately.
