METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis with studies that included patients with severe vs non-severe form of COVID-19 infection. Severe COVID-19 infection was defined as severe pneumonia, mortality, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), use of mechanical ventilation or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) treatment. RESULTS: Three studies, including 1167 patients, reported the incidence of conjunctivitis at admission to the hospital. The overall rate of conjunctivitis was 1.1%; it was 3% and 0.7% in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients, respectively.
