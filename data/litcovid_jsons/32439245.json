DESIGN: This is a retrospective study. SETTING: Twelve hospitals in northern Italy. PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women with COVID-19 confirmed infection who delivered. EXPOSURE: COVID 19 infection in pregnancy. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 infected women who were admitted and delivered during the period 1-20 march 2020 were eligible. Data were collected from the clinical records using a standardized questionnaire on maternal general characteristics, any medical or obstetric co-morbidity, course of pregnancy, clinical signs and symptoms, treatment of COVID 19 infection, mode of delivery, neonatal data and breastfeeding MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Data on mode of delivery and neonatal outcome RESULTS: 42 women with COVID-19 delivered at the participating centres: 24(57,1%, 95% CI= 41,0-72,3) delivered vaginally.
