An online-based pilot survey was conducted to study how people with diabetes were coping with their Diabetes during the COVID - 19 lockdown. METHOD: The questions were designed in an online survey, Survey Monkey, to conduct this cross-sectional study. The link was generated and sent to 100 registered patients of the MV Hospital for Diabetes Royapuram who had not contacted the hospital after the lockdown announcement. The survey was done between April 1 and April 15, 2020.Oral consent was obtained through telephone before the link was sent by Whatsapp to them.The questionnaire consisted of questions on home blood glucose monitoring, regularity in doing their physical activity and dietary compliance and anxiety about the viral infection. RESULTS: 92% of the participants had Type 2 diabetes. Only 28% of the participants were checking their blood glucose levels regularly. 80% of the participants mentioned that they were following regular exercise and diet control during the lockdown period. 40% of the participants were anxious about the Covid infection. CONCLUSION: SMBG needs to be practiced on regular basis, especially among the patients with diabetes on insulin therapy. Most of the people surveyed were coping well with their Diabetes. Patients have reported that they were able to maintain proper dietary compliance and be more physically active at home during this lockdown.

Methods: An online survey was sent across to practicing Indian ophthalmologists across through various social media platforms. All valid responses were tabulated and analyzed. Results: A total of 1260 ophthalmologists responded to the survey. Most of the respondents (775/1260; 61.5%) were in private practice and 14.8% (187/1260) were affiliated to ophthalmic institutes.

In March, it introduced further measures to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), placing the country in a state of almost complete lockdown. We report the impact of these restrictions on glucose control among people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods: Data were collected on 33 individuals with T1D who were monitoring their glucose levels using a flash glucose monitoring device and remotely connected to the diabetes clinic on a cloud platform. We retrieved information on average glucose, standard deviation and percentage time in hypoglycaemia (< 70 mg/dl), glucose range (70-180 mg/dl) and hyperglycaemia (> 180 mg/dl). We compared glycaemic measures collected during lockdown to those collected before the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and to the periods immediately before lockdown. Results: In 20 patients who had stopped working and were at home as a result of the lockdown, overall glycaemic control improved during the first 7 days of the lockdown as compared to the weeks before the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Average glucose declined from 177 +/- 45 mg/dl (week before lockdown) to 160 +/- 40 mg/dl (lockdown; p = 0.005) and the standard deviation improved significantly. Time in range increased from 54.4 to 65.2% (p = 0.010), and time in hyperglycaemia decreased from 42.3 to 31.6% (p = 0.016). The number of scans per day remained unchanged. In 13 patients who continued working, none of the measures of glycaemic control changed during lockdown.
