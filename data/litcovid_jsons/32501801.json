OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine how Internet use, risk awareness, and demographic characteristics are associated with engagement in preventative behaviors and testing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk from April 10, 2020 to April 14, 2020. Participants' Internet use (in terms of the extent of receiving information pertaining to COVID-19), risk awareness (whether any immediate family members, close friends or relatives, or people in local communities tested positive for COVID-19), demographics (sex, age, ethnicity, income, education level, marital status, employment status), as well as their engagement in preventative behaviors and testing were assessed. RESULTS: Our data included 979 valid responses from the U.S. Participants who received more COVID-19-related health information online reported more frequent effort to engage in all types of preventive behaviors: wearing a facemask in public (odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95% CI 1.34-1.79P < .001), washing hands (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.35-1.85, P < .001), covering nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.52-2.10, P < .001), keeping social distance with others (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.21-1.65, P < .001), staying home (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.20-1.62, P < .001), avoiding using public transportation (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32-1.88, P < .001), and cleaning frequently used surfaces (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.34-1.79, P < .001).

OBJECTIVE: This paper describes Chinese citizens' response to the epidemic, the preventive measures they implemented to avoid being infected, and the public strategies that were carried out by the government, health workers, etc. We also discuss the efficacy of these measures in controlling the epidemic in China. METHODS: Information on the responses and behaviors of Chinese citizens were collected through a cross-sectional, internet-based survey using Dingxiang Doctor's public account on WeChat.
