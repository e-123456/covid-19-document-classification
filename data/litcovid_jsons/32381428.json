The histopathological aspect of these lesions is as yet poorly known. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathologic features of CBLL. METHODS: Biopsies were obtained from 17 cases of CBLL during the COVID-19 pandemic in France and were studied by routine histological examination, immunohistochemistry and direct immunofluorescence (DIF). The patients had suspected but unconfirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 (negative nasopharyngeal PCR test and serological tests). RESULTS: CBLL showed many features with those reported in idiopathic (IC) and auto-immune related chilblains (AC), including epidermal necrotic keratinocytes, dermal edema, perivascular and perieccrine sweat gland lymphocytic (predominantly CD3/CD4+) inflammation and frequent vascular changes (endothelialitis, microthromboses, fibrin deposition, immunoreactant deposits on vessels). CONCLUSIONS: CBLL show similar histopathologic features with IC and AC, with a rather high rate of vascular changes and DIF positivity.
