The objective of this study was to examine associations between exposure to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) news, risk perceptions, and depressive symptoms. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected from 501 participants who were >/=18 years. Exposure to COVID-19 news was assessed as our exposure variable. We screened for depression (outcome variable) with the Patient Health Questionnaire and examined the roles of risk perceptions. Multiple linear regressions and mediation analysis with 1000 bootstrap resamples were conducted. RESULTS: Participants were 55.29% female, 67.86% White with mean age 32.44 +/- 11.94 years. After controlling for sociodemographic and socio-economic factors, news exposure was positively associated with depressive symptoms beta = .11; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.02-0.20.
