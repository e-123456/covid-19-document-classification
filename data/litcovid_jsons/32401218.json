The current COVID-19 pandemic illustrates this at a global level. The sudden increased demand on delivery systems puts unique pressures on pre-established care pathways. These extraordinary times require efficient tools for smart governance and resource allocation. OBJECTIVE: To develop an innovative web-based solution addressing the seemingly unsurmountable challenges of triage, monitoring, and delivery of non-hospital services unleashed by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Based on the literature, an existing shared health record platform, and discussions between health care providers, decision-makers, academia, and the private sector in response to the COVID 19 epidemic, an adaptable crisis management digital platform was envisioned and designed with the goal of improving the system's response. RESULTS: The Crisis Management Platform was developed and offered to health authorities in Ontario on a non-profit basis. It has the capability to dramatically streamline patient intake, triage, monitoring, referral, and delivery of non-hospital services. It decentralizes provision of services (by moving them online), and centralizes data gathering and analysis, maximizing utilization of existing human resources, facilitating evidence-based decision-making, and minimizing the risk to both users and providers. It has unlimited scaleup possibilities (only constrained by human health risk resource availability) with minimal marginal cost. Similar web-based solutions have the potential to fill an urgent gap in resource allocation, becoming a unique asset for health systems governance and management during critical times.

Chronic pain is the leading cause of disability in the world, is associated with multiple psychiatric co-morbidities, and has been causally linked for the opioid crisis. Access to pain treatment has been called a fundamental human right by numerous organizations. The current COVID-19 pandemic has strained medical resources, creating a dilemma for physicians charged with a responsibility to limit spread of the contagion, and their responsibility to treat the patients they are entrusted to care for.

PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTINGS: Applicable to the various case management practice settings across the continuum of health and human services, especially acute care. FINDINGS CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 global pandemic crisis has brought an unprecedented challenge to professional case managers and health care professionals. It also has provided opportunities for innovation and partnerships within and across health care organizations and the various care settings where patients/support systems access necessary services. Most importantly, it created a renewed interest in telehealth and facilitated a wider adoption of such approach to care delivery than ever before. This pandemic has also increased the use of nontraditional sites of care, most importantly those that operate virtually on electronic networks and health information system technologies such as remote visits, e-visits, virtual care, and tele-monitoring. Undoubtedly, these have provided new opportunities for tele-case management services and roles for professional case managers in the virtual world of health and human service delivery. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: Professional case managers are integral members of interprofessional health care teams. Their roles are even more necessary during a global pandemic such as COVID-19. The practice of case management will forever change-for the better. The experience of this crisis in health care has brought about ever-lasting implications for case management professionals.
