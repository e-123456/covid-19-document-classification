This study builds on our prior study based on the scientific premise that YouTube is one of the most effective ways to communicate and mobilize the public in community mitigation to reduce exposure to SARS-COV-2. OBJECTIVE: Because of the rapidly changing nature of YouTube in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a follow-up study to document how coverage of preventive behaviors for effective community mitigation have changed. METHODS: A successive sampling design was used to compare coverage of behaviors to mitigate community transmission of COVID-19 in the100 most widely viewed YouTube videos in January 2020 and March 2020. RESULTS: Videos in the two samples were viewed > 125 million times and >355 million times, respectively. Fewer than one-half of the videos in the March sample covered any of the prevention behaviors recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but many covered key prevention behaviors and were very widely viewed. There were no videos uploaded by entertainment television in the January sample but this source comprised the majority of videos and garnered the majority of cumulative views in the March sample.
