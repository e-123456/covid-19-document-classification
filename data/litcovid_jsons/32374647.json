News reports and information about the virus are rapidly changing. We present a case of a patient with COVID-19 who had a seizure-like spell for which an EEG was performed. In early to mid-March, there were no clear guidelines or recommendations available from neurodiagnostic-related organizations or hospitals on how to adapt procedure workflow to those with COVID-19. When caring for COVID-19 patients, as when caring for any patient with an infectious disease, it is hospital protocol to follow contact, droplet/airborne precautions by wearing appropriate PPE. However, because we knew very little about the coronavirus, this case was different. In this article, we discuss our experience with our EEG workflow and concerns for staff exposure. We then discuss our adaptations and modifications to our standard procedures and protocols. A time analysis comparing our standard EEG protocol with our modified COVID-19 protocol revealed a significant decrease in technologist exposure time (99 minutes versus 51 minutes), which theoretically would reduce the chance of virus transmission to our technologist. At this critical moment in time, we hope such modifications will allow us to continue delivering high quality patient care while optimizing resource utilization and above all keeping our technologists safe.","Neurodiagn J","Haines, Seline","Caccamo, Amy","Chan, Fonda","Galaso, German","Catinchi, Alexis","Gupta, Puneet K","32374647"],"abstract":["The coronavirus disease 2019, SARS-COV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), has led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and an increased stress on hospital resources, which has resulted in a spike in the anxiety of the frontline healthcare workers.

Historically, the group of human coronaviruses can also affect the central nervous system leading to neurological symptoms; however, the causative mechanisms of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 disease are not well known. Seizures have not been directly reported as a part of COVID-19 outside of patients with previously known brain injury or epilepsy. We report two cases of acute symptomatic seizures, in non-epileptic patients, associated with severe COVID-19 disease. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Two advanced-age, non-epileptic, male patients presented to our northeast Ohio-based health system with concern for infection in Mid-March 2020. Both had a history of lung disease and during their hospitalization tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. They developed acute encephalopathy days into their hospitalization with clinical and electrographic seizures. Resolution of seizures was achieved with levetiracetam. DISCUSSION: Patients with COVID-19 disease are at an elevated risk for seizures, and the mechanism of these seizures is likely multifactorial. Clinical (motor) seizures may not be readily detected in this population due to the expansive utilization of sedatives and paralytics for respiratory optimization strategies. Many of these patients are also not electrographically monitored for seizures due to limited resources, multifactorial risk for acute encephalopathy, and the risk of cross-contamination. Previously, several neurological symptoms were seen in patients with more advanced COVID-19 disease, and these were thought to be secondary to multi-system organ failure and/or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy-related brain injury. However, these patients may also have an advanced breakdown of the blood-brain barrier precipitated by pro-inflammatory cytokine reactions. The neurotropic effect and neuroinvasiveness of SARS-Coronavirus-2 have not been directly established. CONCLUSIONS: Acute symptomatic seizures are possible in patients with COVID-19 disease. These seizures are likely multifactorial in origin, including cortical irritation due to blood-brain barrier breakdown, precipitated by the cytokine reaction as a part of the viral infection. Patients with clinical signs of seizures or otherwise unexplained encephalopathy may benefit from electroencephalography monitoring and/or empiric anti-epileptic therapy. Further studies are needed to elucidate the risk of seizures and benefit of monitoring in this population.","Neurocrit Care","Hepburn, Madihah","Mullaguri, Naresh","George, Pravin","Hantus, Stephen","Punia, Vineet","Bhimraj, Adarsh","Newey, Christopher R","32462412"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) emerged as a global pandemic.
