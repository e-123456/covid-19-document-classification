OBJECTIVE: To assess health literacy, disease knowledge, treatment dissatisfaction and biologics attitudes toward COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey on 98/105 consecutive dermatological patients treated with biologics - 51 suffering from plaque psoriasis, 22 from atopic dermatitis, and 25 from hidradenitis suppurativa. An ad hoc, validated questionnaire has 44 items investigating the following domains: knowledge of COVID-19 related to i) epidemiology, ii) pathogenesis, iii) clinical symptoms, iv) preventive measures and v) attitudes. Patients data and questionnaires were collected. RESULTS: Despite only 8.1% thought that biologics may increase the risk of COVID-19, 18.4% and 21.4% of the patients were evaluating the possibility to discontinue or modify the dosage of the current biologic therapy, respectively. Globally, male patients(p=0.001) with higher scholarity level(p=0.005) displayed higher knowledge of COVID-19. Patients with lower DLQI(p=0.006), longer disease duration(p=0.051) and lower scholarity(p=0.007) have thought to discontinue/modify autonomously their biologic therapy.At the multivariate logistic regression, only the knowledge of epidemiology and preventive measures resulted independent predictors of continuation versus discontinuation and modification versus no modification, respectively.
