We analyzed case-data from the United States to investigate effects of temperature, precipitation, and UV Light on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Daily reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 across the United States from 01/22/2020 to 04/03/2020 were analyzed. We used negative binomial regression modelling to investigate whether daily maximum temperature, precipitation, UV Index and the incidence 5 days later were related. We performed sensitivity analyses at 3 days, 7 days and 9 days to assess transmission lags. RESULTS: A maximum temperature greater than 52 degrees F on a given day was associated with a lower rate of new cases at 5 days[IRR: 0.85(0.76,0.96)p=0.009]. Among observations with daily temperatures below 52 degrees F, there was a significant inverse association between the maximum daily temperature and the rate of cases at 5 days [IRR 0.98(0.97,0.99)p=0.001]. The rate of new cases was predicted to be lower for theoretical states that maintained a stable maximum daily temperature above 52 degrees F with a predicted 23-fewer cases per-million per-day by 25 days of the epidemic. A 1-unit higher UV index was associated with a lower rate at 5 days [IRR 0.97(0.95,0.99)p=0.004]. Precipitation was not associated with a greater rate of cases at 5 days [IRR 0.98(0.89,1.08)p=0.65]. CONCLUSION: The incidence of disease declines with increasing temperature up until 52 degrees F and is lower at warmer versus cooler temperatures. However, the association between temperature and transmission is small and transmission is likely to remain high at warmer temperatures.","Clin Infect Dis","Sehra, Shiv T","Salciccioli, Justin D","Wiebe, Douglas J","Fundin, Shelby","Baker, Joshua F","32472936"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Previous reports have suggested that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced by higher temperatures and higher humidity.
