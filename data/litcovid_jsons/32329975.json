To ensure availability of donor cells on the scheduled date of infusion, many sites now collect cryopreserve grafts before the start of pretransplant conditioning. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (ptCY), is an increasingly used approach for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis but the impact of graft cryopreservation on the outcomes of allo-HCT using ptCY is not known. Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database, we compared the outcomes of HCT using cryopreserved versus fresh grafts in patients undergoing HCT for hematologic malignancy with ptCY. METHODS: We analyzed 274 patients with hematologic malignancy undergoing allo-HCT from 2013-2018 with cryopreserved grafts and ptCY. Eighteen received bone marrow and 256, peripheral blood grafts. These were matched for age, graft type, disease risk index (DRI) and propensity score to 1,080 patients that underwent allo-HCT with a fresh graft. The propensity score, which is an assessment of the likelihood of receiving a fresh versus cryopreserved graft, was calculated logistic regression to account for the following: disease histology, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), HCT-comorbidity index, conditioning regimen intensity, donor type and recipient race. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease GVHD, non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse/progression and disease-free survival (DFS). Because of multiple comparisons, only p-values <0.01 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The two cohorts (cryopreserved versus fresh) were similar in patient age, KPS, diagnosis, DRI, HCT-comorbidity index, donor/graft source, and conditioning intensity. One-year probabilities of OS were 71.1% (95% confidence interval, 68.3-73.8%) with fresh grafts and 70.3% (64.6-75.7%) with cryopreserved grafts (p=0.81). Corresponding probabilities of OS survival at two years were 60.6% (57.3-63.8%) and 58.7% (51.9-65.4%) (p=0.62). In matched pair regression analysis, graft cryopreservation was not associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality (Hazard Ratio for cryopreserved versus fresh [HR] =1.05, 95% confidence interval, 0.86-1.29, p=0.60). Similarly, rates neutrophil recovery (HR=0.91, 0.80-1.02, p=0.12), platelet recovery (HR=0.88, 0.78-1.00, p=0.05), grade 3-4 acute GVHD (HR=0.78, 0.50-1.22, p=0.27), NRM (HR=1.16, 0.86-1.55, p=0.32) and relapse/progression (HR=1.21, 0.97-1.50, p=0.09) were similar with cryopreserved versus fresh grafts. There were somewhat lower rates chronic GVHD (HR=0.78, 0.61-0.99, p=0.04) and DFS (HR for treatment failure=1.19, 95%CI=1.01-1.29, p=0.04) with graft cryopreservation that were of marginal statistical significance after adjusting for multiple comparisons.
