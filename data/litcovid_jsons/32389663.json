AIM: To report the clinical characteristics, including gastrointestinal symptoms, of COVID-19 in IBD patients, and to assess the risk of COVID-19 in IBD. METHODS: This case series included consecutive IBD patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Age-adjusted cumulative incidences were compared with the general population in the Madrid region. RESULTS: Through April 8, 12 patients of 1918 IBD patients were diagnosed of COVID-19. The average age was 52 years, 75% of the patients were female, and 58.3% had Crohn's disease. Seven patients (58%) were on maintenance treatment with immunomodulators/biologics, of these 4 with combined therapy (33%). Eight patients (66%) required hospitalization (1 intensive care unit admission, and 2 deaths), and 4 patients were isolated at home. Nine patients had diarrhoea ranging between 4-10 loose stools per day (mean 5.4, SD 1.6). In 5 patients (42%) diarrhoea was a presenting symptom. In 2 patients, diarrhoea was the only symptom at debut. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was 6.1 per 1000 IBD patients.
