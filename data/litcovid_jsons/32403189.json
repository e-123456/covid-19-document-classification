This poses a challenge to maintain appropriate patient care while preventing a significant backlog of patients once stay-at-home restrictions are lifted. In practices that are naive to telehealth as an alternative option, providers and staff are experiencing challenges with telemedicine implementation. We aim to provide a comprehensive guide on how to rapidly integrate telemedicine into practice during a pandemic. METHODS: We built a toolkit that details 8 essential components to successful implementation of a telemedicine platform: Provider and staff training, patient education, an existing electronic medical record system, patient and provider investment in hardware, billing and coding integration, information technology support, audiovisual platforms, and patient and caregiver participation. RESULTS: Rapid integration of telemedicine in our practice was required to be compliant with our institution's COVID-19 Taskforce. Within 3 days of this declaration, our large specialty-care clinic converted to a telemedicine platform and we completed 638 visits within the first month of implementation.
