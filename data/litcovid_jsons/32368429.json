A timeline was reconstructed to chronicle significant events. Numbers were obtained for patients on treatment, treatments breaks, and COVID-19 infections amongst staff and patients. Results: The COVID-19 surge had a tremendous impact on the health system including cessation of all of surgeries, including oncologic surgery, as well as transfer of all inpatient oncology services to makeshift outpatient facilities.
