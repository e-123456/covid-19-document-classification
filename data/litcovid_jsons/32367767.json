There is currently no FDA approved antiviral strategy to alleviate the disease burden. The conserved 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)), which controls coronavirus replication is a promising drug target for combating the coronavirus infection. This study screens some African plants derived alkaloids and terpenoids as potential inhibitors of coronavirus 3CL(pro) using in silico approach.Bioactive alkaloids (62) and terpenoids (100) of plants native to Africa were docked to the 3CL(pro) of the novel SARS-CoV-2. The top twenty alkaloids and terpenoids with high binding affinities to the SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) were further docked to the 3CL(pro) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The docking scores were compared with 3CL(pro)-referenced inhibitors (Lopinavir and Ritonavir). The top docked compounds were further subjected to ADEM/Tox and Lipinski filtering analyses for drug-likeness prediction analysis.This ligand-protein interaction study revealed that more than half of the top twenty alkaloids and terpenoids interacted favourably with the coronaviruses 3CL(pro), and had binding affinities that surpassed that of lopinavir and ritonavir. Also, a highly defined hit-list of seven compounds (10-Hydroxyusambarensine, Cryptoquindoline, 6-Oxoisoiguesterin, 22-Hydroxyhopan-3-one, Cryptospirolepine, Isoiguesterin and 20-Epibryonolic acid) were identified. Furthermore, four non-toxic, druggable plant derived alkaloids (10-Hydroxyusambarensine, and Cryptoquindoline) and terpenoids (6-Oxoisoiguesterin and 22-Hydroxyhopan-3-one), that bind to the receptor-binding site and catalytic dyad of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) were identified from the predictive ADME/tox and Lipinski filter analysis. However, further experimental analyses are required for developing these possible leads into natural anti-COVID-19 therapeutic agents for combating the pandemic.","J Biomol Struct Dyn","Gyebi, Gideon A","Ogunro, Olalekan B","Adegunloye, Adegbenro P","Ogunyemi, Oludare M","Afolabi, Saheed O","32367767"],"abstract":["The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-COV-2 has raised myriad of global concerns.
