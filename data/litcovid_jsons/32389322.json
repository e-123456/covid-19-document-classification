This syndrome has been named COVID-19 for CoronaVIrus Disease 2019 by the World Health Organization. The starting point of the epidemic is the city of Wuhan (China), where the virus is said to have been transmitted from animals to humans before inter-human transmission. This is the third epidemic caused by a coronavirus after those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) started in 2012. COVID-19 has rapidly spread to China and is currently spreading all over the world. The infection mainly affects patients over 40 years of age and mortality is increased in the presence of comorbidities. Children are pauci- or asymptomatic. The diagnosis is most often based on the detection of the viral genome in the nasopharynx by molecular biology methods. In the absence of specific anti-viral molecules, treatment is currently mainly symptomatic. It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic is more difficult to control than what the first data suggested. The key strategy to SARS-CoV-2 is to limit its transmission. Preventive measures are mainly based on the application of adequate hand hygiene measures and disinfection of the environment, as well as measures of social distance aimed at limiting contacts in the population and protecting populations at risk.","Rev Med Liege","Davenne, E","Giot, J B","Huynen, P","32267109"],"abstract":["The international community is currently facing a pandemic of acute respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
