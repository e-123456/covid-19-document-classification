OBJECTIVES: To describe the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 disease and to relate them to other clinical findings METHODS: Nationwide case collection survey of images and clinical data. Using a consensus, we described 5 clinical patterns. We later described the association of these patterns with patient demographics, timing in relation to symptoms of the disease, severity, and prognosis. RESULTS: Lesions may be classified as acral areas of erythema with vesicles or pustules (Pseudo-chilblain) (19%), other vesicular eruptions (9%), urticarial lesions (19%), maculopapular eruptions (47%) and livedo or necrosis (6%). Vesicular eruptions appear early in the course of the disease (15% before other symptoms). The pseudo-chilblain pattern frequently appears late in the evolution of the COVID-19 disease (59% after other symptoms), while the rest tend to appear with other symptoms of COVID-19. Severity of COVID-19 shows a gradient from less severe disease in acral lesions to most severe in the latter groups. Results are similar for confirmed and suspected cases, both in terms of clinical and epidemiological findings. Alternative diagnoses are discussed but seem unlikely for the most specific patterns (pseudo-chilblain and vesicular). CONCLUSIONS: We provide a description of the cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection. These may help clinicians approach patients with the disease and recognize paucisymptomatic cases.","Br J Dermatol","Galvan Casas, C","Catala, A","Carretero Hernandez, G","Rodriguez-Jimenez, P","Fernandez Nieto, D","Rodriguez-Villa Lario, A","Navarro Fernandez, I","Ruiz-Villaverde, R","Falkenhain, D","Llamas Velasco, M","Garcia-Gavin, J","Baniandres, O","Gonzalez-Cruz, C","Morillas-Lahuerta, V","Cubiro, X","Figueras Nart, I","Selda-Enriquez, G","Romani, J","Fusta-Novell, X","Melian-Olivera, A","Roncero Riesco, M","Burgos-Blasco, P","Sola Ortigosa, J","Feito Rodriguez, M","Garcia-Doval, I","32348545"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 disease are poorly characterized.
