We aimed to clarify the features of COVID-19-related liver damage to provide references for clinical treatment. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, single-center study of 148 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 (73 female, 75 male; mean age, 50 years) at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20 through January 31, 2020. Patient outcomes were followed until February 19, 2020. Patients were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications, and length of hospital stay. Abnormal liver function was defined as increased levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (37.2%) had abnormal liver function at hospital admission; 14.5% of these patients had high fever (14.5%), compared with 4.3% of patients with normal liver function (P=.027). Patients with abnormal liver function were more likely to be male, and had higher levels of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein. There was no statistical difference between groups in medications taken before hospitalization; a significantly higher proportion of patients with abnormal liver function (57.8%) had received lopinavir/ritonavir after admission compared to patients with normal liver function (31.3%). Patients with abnormal liver function had longer mean hospital stays (15.09+/-4.79 days) than patients with normal liver function (12.76+/-4.14 days) (P=.021). CONCLUSIONS: More than one third of patients admitted to the hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection have abnormal liver function, and this is associated with longer hospital stay. A significantly higher proportion of patients with abnormal liver function had received lopinavir/ritonavir after admission; these drugs should be given with caution.","Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol","Fan, Zhenyu","Chen, Liping","Li, Jun","Cheng, Xin","Jingmao Yang","Tian, Cheng","Zhang, Yajun","Huang, Shaoping","Liu, Zhanju","Cheng, Jilin","32283325"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have abnormal liver function.

Four cases (12.5%) were combined with one underlying disease (bronchial asthma, coronary heart disease, malignant tumor, chronic kidney disease), and one case (3.13%) was simultaneously combined with high blood pressure and malignant tumor.

The research data were analyzed using SPSS19.0 statistical software. Quantitative data were expressed as median (interquartile range), and qualitative data were expressed as frequency and rate. Results: 32 confirmed cases that met the inclusion criteria were included. 28 cases were of mild or moderate type (87.50%), and four cases (12.50%) of severe or critical type. Four cases (12.5%) were combined with one underlying disease (bronchial asthma, coronary heart disease, malignant tumor, chronic kidney disease), and one case (3.13%) was simultaneously combined with high blood pressure and malignant tumor. The results of laboratory examination showed that the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (ALB), and total bilirubin (TBil) for entire cohort were 26.98 (16.88 ~ 46.09) U/L and 24.75 (18.71 ~ 31.79) U/L, 39.00 (36.20 ~ 44.20) g/L and 16.40 (11.34- ~ 21.15) mmol/L, respectively. ALT, AST, ALB and TBil of the mild or moderate subgroups were 22.75 (16.31- ~ 37.25) U/L, 23.63 (18.71 ~ 26.50) U/L, 39.70 (36.50 ~ 46.10) g/L, and 15.95 (11.34 ~ 20.83) mmol/L, respectively. ALT, AST, ALB and TBil of the severe or critical subgroups were 60.25 (40.88 ~ 68.90) U/L, 37.00 (20.88 ~ 64.45) U/L, 35.75 (28.68 ~ 42.00) g/L, and 20.50 (11.28 ~ 25.00) mmol/L, respectively. Conclusion: The results of this multicenter retrospective study suggests that novel coronavirus pneumonia combined with liver damage is more likely to be caused by adverse drug reactions and systemic inflammation in severe patients receiving medical treatment. Therefore, liver function monitoring and evaluation should be strengthened during the treatment of such patients."],"journal":"Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi","authors":["Liu, C","Jiang, Z C","Shao, C X","Zhang, H G","Yue, H M","Chen, Z H","Ma, B Y","Liu, W Y","Huang, H H","Yang, J","Wang, Y","Liu, H Y","Xu, D","Wang, J T","Yang, J Y","Pan, H Q","Zou, S Q","Li, F J","Lei, J Q","Li, X","He, Q","Gu, Y","Qi, X L"],"date":"2020-02-21T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32077660","week":"20208|Feb 17 - Feb 23","doi":"10.3760/cma.j.issn.1007-3418.2020.02.003","keywords":["Clinical typing","Hypohepatia","Liver function","NCP"],"source":"PubMed","topics":["Treatment","Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"e_drugs":["Bilirubin"],"_version_":1663352134578470912,"score":257.65222}]}
