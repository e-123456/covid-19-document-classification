In this report, a bioinformatics analysis of network pharmacology was conducted to demonstrate screening targets, biological functions, and the signaling pathways of VC action against sepsis. As shown in network assays, 63 primary causal targets for the VC action against sepsis were identified from the data, and four optimal core targets for the VC action against sepsis were identified.

Twenty-two (50.0%) of the non-survivors and 24 (49.0%) of the survivors were infected with the influenza virus. Critically ill COVID-19 patients with influenza were more prone to cardiac injury than those without influenza. For the laboratory indicators at admission, white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, D-dimer value, and proportion of elevated creatinine were higher in non-survivors with influenza than in those without influenza. CONCLUSION: The results showed a high proportion of COVID-19 patients were co-infected with influenza in Tongji Hospital, with no significant difference in the proportion of co-infection between survivors and non-survivors. The critically ill COVID-19 patients with influenza exhibited more severe inflammation and organ injury, indicating that co-infection with the influenza virus may induce an earlier and more frequently occurring cytokine storm.","Int J Infect Dis","Ma, Simin","Lai, Xiaoquan","Chen, Zhe","Tu, Shenghao","Qin, Kai","32470606"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To delineate the clinical characteristics of critically ill COVID-19 patients co-infected with influenza.
