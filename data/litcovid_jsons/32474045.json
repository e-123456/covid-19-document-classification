METHODS: In this study, we included adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 form Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China), with or without influenza, and compared their clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Among 93 patients, 44 died and 49 were discharged. Forty-four (47.3%) were infected with influenza virus A and 2 (2.2%) with influenza virus B. Twenty-two (50.0%) of the non-survivors and 24 (49.0%) of the survivors were infected with the influenza virus. Critically ill COVID-19 patients with influenza were more prone to cardiac injury than those without influenza. For the laboratory indicators at admission, white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, D-dimer value, and proportion of elevated creatinine were higher in non-survivors with influenza than in those without influenza. CONCLUSION: The results showed a high proportion of COVID-19 patients were co-infected with influenza in Tongji Hospital, with no significant difference in the proportion of co-infection between survivors and non-survivors. The critically ill COVID-19 patients with influenza exhibited more severe inflammation and organ injury, indicating that co-infection with the influenza virus may induce an earlier and more frequently occurring cytokine storm.","Int J Infect Dis","Ma, Simin","Lai, Xiaoquan","Chen, Zhe","Tu, Shenghao","Qin, Kai","32470606"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To delineate the clinical characteristics of critically ill COVID-19 patients co-infected with influenza.
