We determined the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and characterized the symptoms of patients with mild COVID-19. METHODS: We recruited the study participants from a community facility designated for isolation of patients without moderate-to-severe symptoms of COVID-19 in South Korea. The prevalence of asymptomatic patients at admission and the detailed symptoms of mild COVID-19 were evaluated through a questionnaire-based survey. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Of the 213 patients with COVID-19, 41 (19.2%) were asymptomatic until admission. Among the remaining patients with mild COVID-19, the most common symptom was cough (40.1% [69/172]), followed by hyposmia (39.5% [68/172]) and sputum (39.5%, [68/172]). Of the 68 patients with hyposmia, 61 (90%) patients had accompanying symptoms such as hypogeusia, nasal congestion, or rhinorrhea. Fever (>37.5 degrees C) was only observed in 20 (11.6%). CONCLUSIONS: As much as one-fifth of patients with COVID-19 had remained asymptomatic from exposure to admission. Hyposmia was quite frequent among patients with mild COVID-19, whereas fever was not. Social distancing should be strongly implemented to prevent disease transmission from asymptomatic patients or those with mild and inconspicuous symptoms.","Clin Microbiol Infect","Kim, Gwang-Un","Kim, Min-Jae","Ra, Sang Hyun","Lee, Jeongsoo","Bae, Seongman","Jung, Jiwon","Kim, Sung-Han","32360780"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVES: Detailed knowledge on the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and the clinical characteristics of mild COVID-19 is essential for effective control of the COVID-19 pandemic.
