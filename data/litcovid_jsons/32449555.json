We invited ED researchers from editorial boards and scientific organizations to complete a quantitative/qualitative survey about: COVID-19's current and future impact on ED research; areas of concern about research disruptions; and effective strategies for conducting and supporting research during and after COVID-19. Among 187 participants, many had moved studies online and/or shutdown part of their research. Across position types (permanent, 52.7%; temporary, 47.3%), participants reported high concern about data collection, recruitment, and securing future funding. Those holding temporary positions reported significantly greater concern about COVID-19's impact on their career and greater stress than participants in permanent positions. Strategies for dealing with research disruptions included: employing technology; reprioritizing goals/tasks; and encouraging collaboration.
