METHODS: We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service to the designated hospitals. The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID-19 virus, diagnostic classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained. Furthermore we compared the characteristics between severe and common confirmed cases which including mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS. FINDINGS: By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beijing emergency medical service.

In heart failure group, the ratio of the expansion of small pulmonary veins was also higher (3/7 vs. 0, P=0.013), and the lung lesions can be significantly improved after effective anti-heart failure treatment. Besides, there are more disease with rounded morphology in COVID-19 (9/12 vs. 2/7, P=0.048) . Conclusions: More patients with COVID-19 have epidemiological history and fever or respiratory symptoms. There are significant differences in chest CT features, such as enlargement of pulmonary veins, lesions distribution and morphology between heart failure and COVID-19."],"journal":"Zhonghua Xin Xue Guan Bing Za Zhi","authors":["Zhu, Z W","Tang, J J","Chai, X P","Fang, Z F","Liu, Q M","Hu, X Q","Xu, D Y","Tang, L","Tai, S","Wu, Y Z","Zhou, S H"],"date":"2020-03-05T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32129583","week":"202010|Mar 02 - Mar 08","doi":"10.3760/cma.j.cn112148-20200218-00093","keywords":["COVID-19","Heart failure","Pulmonary computed tomography"],"source":"PubMed","topics":["Mechanism"],"weight":1,"_version_":1661359647677743104,"score":152.88379}]}
