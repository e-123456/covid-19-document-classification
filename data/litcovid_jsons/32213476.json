METHODS: Clinical researchers have an obligation to help, and we can. Recommendations for clinical researchers working with older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed. RESULTS: Implement technology now: Minimize face-to-face contact with participants by utilizing digital tools, such as shifting to electronic informed consent and digital HIPAA-compliant tools like emailed surveys or telehealth assessments. Assess the psychological and social impact of COVID-19: How are participants coping? What health or social behaviors have changed? How are they keeping up with current events? What are they doing to stay connected to their families, friends, and communities? Are their health care needs being met? Current studies should be adapted immediately to these ends. Mobilize research platforms for patient needs: Leverage our relationships with participants and rapidly deploy novel clinical engagement techniques such as digital tools to intervene remotely to reduce the negative effects of social isolation on our participants. Equip research staff with tangible resources, and provide timely population-specific health information to support patients and healthcare providers.

However, the information found on the Internet often lacks scientific rigor, as anyone may upload its content. This factor is a cause of great concern to scientific societies, governments, and users. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the information about the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the Internet. METHODS: On 2020-02-29 we performed a Google search with the terms \"Prevention coronavirus\", \"Prevention COVID-19\", \"Prevencion coronavirus\", and \"Prevencion COVID-19\". A univariate analysis was performed to study the association between the type of authorship, and country of publication, and recommendations to avoid COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization. RESULTS: In total, 80 weblinks were reviewed. Most of them were produced in the USA and Spain (72.5%), by digital media and official public health organizations (75.1%). The most mentioned WHO preventive measure was \"wash your hands frequently\" (81.3%). Less frequent recommendation was related to \"stay home if you feel unwell\" (32.5%). The analysis by type of author (official public health organizations versus digital media) revealed significant differences regarding the recommendation to wear a mask if you are healthy only if caring for a person with suspected COVID-19 (OR = 4.39). According to country of publication (Spain versus the USA) significant differences were detected regarding some recommendations, such as \"wash your hands frequently\" (OR = 9.82), \"cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze\" (OR = 4.59), or \"stay home if you feel unwell\" (OR = 0.31). CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to urge and promote the use of the websites of official public health organizations when seeking information on COVID-19 preventive measures on the Internet.
