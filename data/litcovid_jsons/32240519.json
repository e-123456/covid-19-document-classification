We recorded findings at any chest CT performed in the included children, along with core clinical observations. RESULTS: We included five children from 10 months to 6 years of age (mean 3.4 years). All had had at least one CT scan after admission. Three of these five had CT abnormality on the first CT scan (at 2 days, 4 days and 9 days, respectively, after onset of symptoms) in the form of patchy ground-glass opacities; all normalised during treatment. CONCLUSION: Compared to reports in adults, we found similar but more modest lung abnormalities at CT in our small paediatric cohort.","Pediatr Radiol","Li, Wei","Cui, Huaqian","Li, Kunwei","Fang, Yijie","Li, Shaolin","32162081"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Infection with COVID-19 is currently rare in children.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chest CT images of 72 symptomatic patients with corona virus disease (COVID-19) were analyzed retrospectively, including 44 younger patients (47.5+/-8.7 y old) and 28 older patients (68.4+/-6.0 y old). CT findings including density (pure ground-glass opacities, ground-glass opacities with consolidation, consolidation), the number of lobes involved, lesion distribution, and the main accompanying signs were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Characteristic CT findings included the lobes of bilateral lung extensively involved, ground-glass opacity and ground-glass opacity with consolidation in the peripheral area, sometimes accompanied by interlobular septal thickening, and subpleural line and pleural thickening. Compared with the younger group, the proportion of extensive involvement of lung lobes was higher in the elderly group (71.4% vs. 36.4%, P=0.009), and subpleural line and pleural thickening were more likely to occur (50.0% vs. 25.0%, and 71.4% vs. 40.9%, P=0.030 and 0.011, respectively).
