In this context, autopsies are important to confirm the disease, determine associated conditions, and study the pathophysiology of this novel disease. In order to follow biosafety recommendations, we used Ultrasound-Guided Minimally Invasive Autopsy (MIA-US) to assess the systemic involvement of COVID-19 and present the results of ten initial autopsies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used MIA-US for tissue sampling of lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, spleen, brain, skin, skeletal muscle and testis for histology and RT-PCR to detect SARS-COV-2-RNA. All patients presented exudative/proliferative Diffuse Alveolar Damage. There were intense pleomorphic cytopathic effects on the respiratory epithelium, including airway and alveolar cells. Fibrinous thrombi in alveolar arterioles were present in eight patients and all patients presented a high density of alveolar megakaryocytes. Small thrombi were less frequently observed in glomeruli, spleen, heart, dermis, testis, and liver sinusoids. The main systemic findings were associated with comorbidities, age, and sepsis, in addition to possible tissue damage due to the viral infection such as myositis, dermatitis, myocarditis and orchitis. CONCLUSIONS: MIA-US is safe and effective for the study of severe COVID-19. Our findings show that COVID-19 is a systemic disease with major events in the lungs and involvement of various organs and tissues. Pulmonary changes are the result of severe epithelial injury and microthrombotic vascular phenomena. These findings indicate that both epithelial and vascular injury should be addressed in therapeutic approaches.","Histopathology","Nunes Duarte-Neto, Amaro","de Almeida Monteiro, Renata Aparecida","da Silva, Luiz Fernando Ferraz","Malheiros, Denise Maria Avancini Costa","de Oliveira, Ellen Pierre","Theodoro Filho, Jair","Pinho, Joao Renato Rebello","Soares Gomes-Gouvea, Michele","Salles, Ana Paula Moreira","de Oliveira, Ilka Regina Souza","Mauad, Thais","do Nascimento Saldiva, Paulo Hilario","Dolhnikoff, Marisa","32443177"],"abstract":["AIMS: Brazil ranks high in the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19's mortality rate.

Methods: Minimally invasive autopsies from lung, heart, kidney, spleen, bone marrow, liver, pancreas, stomach, intestine, thyroid and skin were performed on three patients died of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Chongqing, China. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) and histochemical staining were performed to investigate the pathological changes of indicated organs or tissues. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted to evaluate the infiltration of immune cells as well as the expression of 2019-nCoV proteins. Real time PCR was carried out to detect the RNA of 2019-nCoV. Results: Various damages were observed in the alveolar structure, with minor serous exudation and fibrin exudation. Hyaline membrane formation was observed in some alveoli. The infiltrated immune cells in alveoli were majorly macrophages and monocytes. Moderate multinucleated giant cells, minimal lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils were also observed. Most of infiltrated lymphocytes were CD4-positive T cells. Significant proliferation of type II alveolar epithelia and focal desquamation of alveolar epithelia were also indicated. The blood vessels of alveolar septum were congested, edematous and widened, with modest infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes. Hyaline thrombi were found in a minority of microvessels. Focal hemorrhage in lung tissue, organization of exudates in some alveolar cavities, and pulmonary interstitial fibrosiswere observed. Part of the bronchial epithelia were exfoliated. Coronavirus particles in bronchial mucosal epithelia and type II alveolar epithelia were observed under electron microscope. Immunohistochemical staining showed that part of the alveolar epithelia and macrophages were positive for 2019-nCoV antigen. Real time PCR analyses identified positive signals for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. Decreased numbers of lymphocyte, cell degeneration and necrosis were observed in spleen. Furthermore, degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells, formation of hyaline thrombus in small vessels, and pathological changes of chronic diseases were observed in other organs and tissues, while no evidence of coronavirus infection was observed in these organs. Conclusion: s The lungs from novel coronavirus pneumonia patients manifest significant pathological lesions, including the alveolar exudative inflammation and interstitial inflammation, alveolar epithelium proliferation and hyaline membrane formation. While the 2019-nCoV is mainly distributed in lung, the infection also involves in the damages of heart, vessels, liver, kidney and other organs.
