CONTEXT AND SETTING: Our large (>12,000,000 tests/year) academic hospital laboratory is the Belgian National Reference Center (NRC) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing. We performed a moving total of > 25,000 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in parallel to standard routine testing since the start of the outbreak. A LIS implementation team dedicated to develop tools to remove the bottlenecks, primarily situated in the pre- and post-analytical phase, was established early in the crisis. RESULTS: We outline the design, implementation and requirements of LIS functionality related to managing increased test demand during the COVID-19 crisis, including tools for test ordering, standardized order sets integrated into a computerized provider order entry module, notifications on shipping requirements, automated triaging based on digital metadata forms, and the establishment of databases with contact details of other laboratories and primary care physicians to enable automated reporting. We also describe our approach to data mining and reporting of actionable daily summary statistics to governing bodies and other policymakers. DISCUSSION: Rapidly developed, agile extendable LIS functionality and its meaningful use alleviates the administrative burden on laboratory personnel and improves turn-around-time of SARS-CoV-2 testing. It will be important to maintain an environment that is conducive for the rapid adoption of meaningful LIS tools post-COVID crisis.","J Am Med Inform Assoc","Weemaes, Matthias","Martens, Steven","Cuypers, Lize","Van Elslande, Jan","Hoet, Katrien","Welkenhuysen, Joris","Goossens, Ria","Wouters, Stijn","Houben, Els","Jeuris, Kirsten","Laenen, Lies","Bruyninckx, Katrien","Beuselinck, Kurt","Andre, Emmanuel","Depypere, Melissa","Desmet, Stefanie","Lagrou, Katrien","Van Ranst, Marc","Verdonck, Ann K L C","Goveia, Jermaine","32348469"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To describe the development, implementation and requirements of laboratory information system (LIS) functionality to manage test ordering, registration, sample flow, and result reporting during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The outbreak was attributed to a novel coronavirus (CoV), named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and the disease as COVID-19. Within one month, cases were reported from 25 countries. In view of the novel viral strain with reported high morbidity, establishing early countrywide diagnosis to detect imported cases became critical. Here we describe the role of a countrywide network of VRDLs in early diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: : The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, established screening as well as confirmatory assays for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 13 VRDLs were provided with the E gene screening real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. VRDLs were selected on the basis of their presence near an international airport/seaport and their past performance. The case definition for testing included all individuals with travel history to Wuhan and symptomatic individuals with travel history to other parts of China. This was later expanded to include symptomatic individuals returning from Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and South Korea. Results: : Within a week of standardization of the test at NIV, all VRDLs could initiate testing for SARS-CoV-2. Till February 29, 2020, a total of 2,913 samples were tested. This included both 654 individuals quarantined in the two camps and others fitting within the case definition. The quarantined individuals were tested twice - at days 0 and 14. All tested negative on both occasions. Only three individuals belonging to different districts in Kerala were found to be positive.
