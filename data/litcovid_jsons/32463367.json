Therefore, measuring and analyzing online health communication and public sentiment is essential for establishing effective and efficient disease control policies, especially in the early stage of the outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the trends of online health communication, analyze the focus of people's anxiety in the early stages of COVID-19, and evaluate the appropriateness of online information. METHODS: From NAVER, the most popular Korean web portal, 13,148 questions and 29,040 answers related to COVID-19 from 01/20/2020 to 03/02/2020 were collected. Three main methods were used in this study: 1) the structural topic model was used to examine the topics in the online questions, 2) word network analysis was conducted to analyze the focus of people's anxiety and worry in the questions, and 3) two medical doctors assessed the appropriateness of the answers to the questions, which were primarily related to people's anxiety. RESULTS: Fifty topics and six cohesive topic communities were identified from the questions. Among them, topic community No. 4 (suspecting COVID-19 infection after developing a particular symptom) accounted for the largest portion of the questions. As the number of confirmed patients increased, the proportion of topics belonging to topic community No. 4 also increased. Additionally, the prolonged situation led to a slight increase in the proportion of topics related to job issues. People's anxieties and worries were closely related with physical symptoms and self-protection methods. While relatively appropriate to suspect physical symptoms, a high proportion of answers related to self-protection methods were assessed as misinformation or advertisements. CONCLUSIONS: Search activity for online information regarding the COVID-19 outbreak has been active. Many of the online questions were related to people's anxieties and worries. A considerable portion of corresponding answers had false information or were advertisements. The study results could contribute reference information to various countries that need to monitor public anxiety and provide appropriate information in the early stage of an infectious disease outbreak, including COVID-19. Our research also contributes to developing methods for measuring public opinion and sentiment in an epidemic situation based on natural language data on the Internet.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to events related to COVID-19 in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. METHODS: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST Content Mining System version 6.0 was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content. RESULTS: The study has four main findings. First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage were slightly different. Third, the emotional tendency of the public toward the COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics changed from negative to neutral, with negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. Fourth, we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories: the situation of the new cases of COVID-19 and its impact, frontline reporting of the epidemic and the measures of prevention and control, expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection, medical services on the frontline of the epidemic, and focus on the worldwide epidemic and the search for suspected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that social media (eg, Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention toward public health emergencies.

China has experienced the unprecedented epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in an era when social media has fundamentally transformed information production and consumption patterns. OBJECTIVE: This study examined public engagement and government responsiveness in the communications about COVID-19 during the early epidemic stage based on analysis of data from Sina Weibo, a major social media platform in China. METHODS: Weibo data relevant to COVID-19 from December 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020 were retrieved. Engagement data (Likes, Comments, Shares and Followers) of posts from government agency accounts were extracted to evaluate public engagement with government posts online. Content analyses were conducted for a random subset of 644 posts from personal accounts of individuals, and 273 posts from 10 relatively more active government agency accounts and the National Health Commission of China to identify major thematic contents in online discussions. Latent class analysis (LCA) was employed to further explore main content patterns while Chi-square for trend examined how proportions of main content patterns changed by time within the study timeframe. RESULTS: Public response to COVID-19 seemed to follow the spread of the disease and government actions but was earlier on Weibo than the government. Online users generally had low engagement with posts relevant COVID-19 from government agency accounts. The common content patterns identified in personal and government posts included sharing epidemic situation, general knowledge of the new disease, and policies, guidelines and official actions. However, personal posts more likely showed empathy to affected people (chi-square=13.3, P<.001), attributed blame to other individuals or government (chi-square=28.9, P<.001), and expressed worry about the epidemic (chi-square=32.1, P<.001) while government posts more likely shared instrumental support (chi-square=32.5, P<.001) and praised people or organizations (chi-square=8.7, P=.003). As the epidemic evolved, sharing situation update (chi-square for trend=19.7, P<.001), and policies, guidelines and official actions (chi-square for trend=15.3, P<.001) became less frequent in personal posts but remained stable or increased significantly in government posts. Moreover, as the epidemic evolved, showing empathy and attributing blame (chi-square for trend=25.3, P<.001) became more frequent in personal posts, corresponding to a slight increase in sharing instrumental support, praising and empathy in government posts (chi-square for trend=9.0, P=.003). CONCLUSIONS: The government should closely monitor social media data to improve the timing of communications about an epidemic.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the Israeli Public's response to the Israeli government's emergency instructions against the pandemic in terms of correlations between: (1) overall risk perceptions and crisis management, (2) overall risk perceptions and economic threat, (3) crisis management and the compliance to behavioral guidelines, (4) crisis management and economic threat, and comparisons between (1) crisis management and spokesperson credibility, and (2) crisis management and source of information credibility. METHODS: The sample was planned using a Qualtrics XM online survey that provided the quick and effective distribution of an online questionnaire during the COVID-19 crisis. Self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit participants (n=1056) through social network posts calling on the general public (18+) to answer the survey. RESULTS: Participants aged 65+ perceived higher personal risk compared to aged 18-30 (mean difference 0.33, 95% CI 0.04-0.61) and compared to aged 46-64 (mean difference 0.38, 95% CI=0.12-0.64).

METHODS: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms (\"corona,\" \"2019-nCov,\" and \"COVID-19\"), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic. RESULTS: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings). CONCLUSIONS: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media. There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the spread of fake news.","J Med Internet Res","Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa","Alhuwail, Dari","Househ, Mowafa","Hamdi, Mounir","Shah, Zubair","32287039"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is taking a toll on the world's health care infrastructure as well as the social, economic, and psychological well-being of humanity. Individuals, organizations, and governments are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not much is known about the topics being shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately.
