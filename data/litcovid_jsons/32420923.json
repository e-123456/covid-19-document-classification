From that date, the Regional Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Trust (AREU) of the Lombardy region decided to apply Business Intelligence (BI) to the management of EMS during the epidemic. The aim of the study is to assess in this context the impact of BI on EMS management outcomes. METHODS: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, AREU is using BI daily to track the number of first aid requests received from 112. BI analyses the number of requests that have been classified as respiratory and/or infectious episodes during the telephone dispatch interview. Moreover, BI allows identifying the numerical trend of episodes in each municipality (increasing, stable, decreasing). RESULTS: AREU decides to reallocate in the territory the resources based on real-time data recorded and elaborated by BI. Indeed, based on that data, the numbers of vehicles and personnel have been implemented in the municipalities that registered more episodes and where the clusters are supposed to be. BI has been of paramount importance in taking timely decisions on the management of EMS during COVID-19 outbreak. Conclusions: Even if there is little evidence-based literature focused on BI impact within the health care, this study suggests that BI can be usefully applied to promptly identify clusters and patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and, consequently, make informed decisions that can improve the EMS management response to the outbreak.","Acta Biomed","Sechi, Giuseppe Maria","Migliori, Maurizio","Dassi, Gabriele","Pagliosa, Andrea","Bonora, Rodolfo","Oradini-Alacreu, Aurea","Odone, Anna","Signorelli, Carlo","Zoli, Alberto","Response Team, Areu Covid-","32420923"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: On the 21st of February, the first patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at Codogno hospital in the Lombardy region.

With the Internet harvesting large amounts of data from the general population in real-time, public databases such as Google Trends (GT) and the Baidu Index (BI) can be an expedient tool to assist public health efforts. OBJECTIVE: To apply digital epidemiology to the current COVID-19 pandemic to determine utility in the providing adjunctive epidemiologic information on outbreaks of this disease and evaluate this methodology in the case of future pandemics. METHODS: An epidemiologic time-series analysis of online search trends relating to the COVID-19 pandemic was performed from January 9, 2020 to April 6, 2020. BI was used to obtain online search data for China, while GT was utilized for worldwide data, the countries of Italy and Spain and the American states of New York and Washington. These data were compared to real-world confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19. Chronologic patterns were assessed in relation to disease patterns, significant events, and media reports. RESULTS: Worldwide search terms for shortness of breath, anosmia, dysgeusia/ageusia, headache, chest pain, and sneezing had strong correlations (r>.60, P<.001) to both new daily confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19. GT COVID-19 (search term) and GT coronavirus (virus) searches predated RW confirmed cases by 12 days (r=.85+/-.10 and r=.76+/-.09 respectively, P<.001). Searches for symptoms of diarrhea, fever, shortness of breath, cough, nasal obstruction, and rhinorrhea all had a negative lag of greater than one week compared to new daily cases; whereas, searches for anosmia and dysgeusia peaked worldwide and in China with positive lags of 5 days and 6 weeks, respectively, corresponding with widespread media coverage of these symptoms in COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the utility of digital epidemiology in providing helpful surveillance data of disease outbreaks like COVID-19. While certain online search trends for this disease were influenced by media coverage, many search terms reflected clinical manifestations of the disease and showed strong correlations with real-world cases and deaths.
