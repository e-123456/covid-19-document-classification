Methods: Epidemiological investigation was conducted to collect the information of confirmed COVID-19 cases, including demographic, epidemiological and clinical information. Results: As of 25 February 2020, a total of 91 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in Gansu. The epidemic of COVID-19 in Gansu can be divided as three different stages, i.e. imported case stage, imported-case plus indigenous case stage, and indigenous case stage. A total of 63 cases were clustered cases (69.23%), 3 cases were medical staff infected with non-occupational exposure. The initial symptoms included fever (54.95%, 50/91), cough (52.75%, 48/91), or fatigue (28.57%, 26/91), the proportion of each symptom showed a decreasing trend along with the three epidemic stages, but only the differences in proportions of fever (trend chi(2)=2.20, P<0.05) and fatigue (trend chi(2)=3.18, P<0.05) among the three epidemic stages were statistically significant.
