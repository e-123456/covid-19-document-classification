According to the World Health Organization (WHO) statement on March 13, 2020, there had been over 132,500 confirmed cases globally.

The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear. This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence. METHODS: The clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients' oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed. Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs. The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed. RESULTS: In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0-62.0) years were analyzed. After in-hospital treatment, patients' inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition. The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0-11.0) days. By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients' stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0-16.0) days after symptom onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0-4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients' urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression model (F = 2.669, P = 0.044, and adjusted R = 0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients' stools (t = -2.699, P = 0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, respectively; t = 2.550, P = 0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; t = 4.631, P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease. The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.","Chin Med J (Engl)","Ling, Yun","Xu, Shui-Bao","Lin, Yi-Xiao","Tian, Di","Zhu, Zhao-Qin","Dai, Fa-Hui","Wu, Fan","Song, Zhi-Gang","Huang, Wei","Chen, Jun","Hu, Bi-Jie","Wang, Sheng","Mao, En-Qiang","Zhu, Lei","Zhang, Wen-Hong","Lu, Hong-Zhou","32118639"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: A patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta.

Results: The age of the 31 children with 2019-nCoV infection was 7 years and 1 month (6 months -17 years). Nine cases (29%) were imported cases. Other 21 cases (68%) had contact with confirmed infected adults. One case (3%) had contact with asymptomatic returnees from Wuhan. Among the 31 children, 28 patients (90%) were family cluster cases.

One case of placenta showed the concomitant morphology of chorionic hemangioma and another one with massive placental infarction. No pathological change of villitis and chorioamnionitis was observed in our observation of three cases. All samples from three placentas were negative for the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of pregnant women with 2019-nCoV infection in late pregnancy are similar to those of non-pregnant patients, and no severe adverse pregnancy outcome is found in the 3 cases of our observation. Pathological study suggests that there are no morphological changes related to infection in the three placentas. Currently no evidence for intrauterine vertical transmission of 2019-nCoV is found in the three women infected by 2019-nCoV in their late pregnancy."],"journal":"Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi","authors":["Chen, S","Huang, B","Luo, D J","Li, X","Yang, F","Zhao, Y","Nie, X","Huang, B X"],"date":"2020-03-03T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32114744","week":"202010|Mar 02 - Mar 08","doi":"10.3760/cma.j.cn112151-20200225-00138","keywords":["2019-nCoV","Clinical characteristic","Pneumonia","placental pathology","prgnant women","vertical transmission"],"source":"PubMed","topics":["Case Report"],"weight":1,"_version_":1662334544114614272,"score":214.5495}]}
