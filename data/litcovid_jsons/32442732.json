We attempt to report our experience in carrying out neurosurgical services in Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, during the time of the pandemic. METHODS: To collect information on the effect of the pandemic in Indonesia and Yogyakarta, we gathered data from the Indonesian Ministry of Health online database for the national data and local government records for the local data (including records of Dr. Sardjito General Hospital Division of Neurosurgery). RESULTS: Compared to other countries, Indonesia has not been severely hit by the impact of COVID-19. To raise the understanding of the natural history of the pandemic, we grouped the period into four different phases: Phase 1 (there was confirmed cases in Indonesia but no cases found in Yogyakarta), Phase 2 (the first case in Yogyakarta detected), Phase 3 (the time when the cumulative cases surpass its peak), and Phase 4 (the pandemic ends). At the time of this writing, we were still in Phase 2 and in this phase, we experienced a decrease in the number of emergency surgical procedures, from an average of 4 to 2.4 procedures per week. Moreover, the number of elective operations dropped from an average of 12 to 9 procedures per week. CONCLUSIONS: A pandemic, such as COVID-19, reduces both inpatient and outpatient neurosurgical activities. A comprehensive plan can improve both utilization and safety of the neurosurgical staff.","World Neurosurg","Manusubroto, Wiryawan","Wicaksono, Adiguno S","Tamba, Daniel Agriva","Sudiharto, Paulus","Pramusinto, Handoyo","Hartanto, Rachmat Andi","Basuki, Endro","32442732"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Most articles describing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on neurosurgical services have been from developed countries.

We simulated the future trajectory of the epidemic under current conditions, projected the impact of policy interventions, and analyzed the implications for healthcare capacity. METHODS: Our study was based on the first month of publicly accessible data on new confirmed daily cases. A susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered (SEIR) model for COVID-19 was employed to compare the current dynamics of the disease with those predicted under various scenarios. RESULTS: The fitted model for the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Bali indicated an effective reproduction number of 1.4. Interventions have decreased the possible maximum number of cases from 71 125 on day 86 to 22 340 on day 119, and have prolonged the doubling time from about 9 days to 21 days. This corresponds to an approximately 30% reduction in transmissions from cases of mild infections. There will be 2780 available hospital beds, and at the peak (on day 132), the number of severe cases is estimated to be roughly 6105. Of these cases, 1831 will need intensive care unit (ICU) beds, whereas the number of currently available ICU beds is roughly 446.
