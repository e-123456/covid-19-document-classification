METHODS: We searched for information on ehealth services related to the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. The sources of information were mainstream search engines such as Baidu and the popular interactive social platforms such as Webchat. The keywords were \"Internet+pneumonia\", \"Internet clinic\", \"pneumonia online clinic\" and so on. The time of information was from January 20 to February 3, 2020. The key information was extracted and encoded by two persons back-to-back. The coding information included: name of organization provider, launching time, location of provider, service items, user, health workers engaging in the service, and so on. The coded information was entered and analyzed with SPSS 24.0 and Excel. RESULTS: There were totally 57 projects launched by local governments, hospitals and IT companies.

RESULTS: Fifteen percent of pediatricians reported any telehealth use in the 12 months prior to the survey.
