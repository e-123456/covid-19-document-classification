To continue transplantation while protecting immunocompromised patients and health care workers, significant restructuring of normal patient care practice habits is required. METHODS: This is a nonrandomized, descriptive study of the abdominal transplant program at 1 academic center (University of California, San Francisco) and the programmatic changes undertaken to safely continue transplantations. Patient transfers, fellow use, and patient discharge education were identified as key areas requiring significant reorganization. RESULTS: The University of California, San Francisco abdominal transplant program took an early and aggressive approach to restructuring inpatient workflows and health care worker staffing. The authors formalized a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transfer system to address patients in need of services at their institution while minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 in their transplant ward and used technological approaches to provide virtual telehealth where possible. They also modified their transplant fellow staffing and responsibilities to develop an adequate backup system in case of potential exposures. CONCLUSION: Every transplant program is unique, and an individualized plan to adapt and modify standard clinical practices will be required to continue providing essential transplantation services.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A qualitative study with voluntary dyadic and focus group interviews with a total of 30 General Surgery residents enrolled at 2 academic medical centers in Boston, Massachusetts was conducted between March 12 to 16, 2020. RESULTS: The most commonly reported personal concern related to the COVID-19 outbreak was the health of their family (30 of 30 [100%]), followed by the risk of their transmitting COVID-19 infection to their family members (24 of 30 [80%]); risk of their transmitting COVID-19 infection their patients (19 of 30 [63%]); anticipated overwork for taking care of a high number of patients (15 of 30 [50%]); and risk of their acquiring COVID-19 infection from their patients (8 of 30 [27%]) .
