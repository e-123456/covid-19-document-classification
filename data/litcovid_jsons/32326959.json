Firstly, to select the proper size of nasal catheter, to locate it at suitable place, and to confirm the nose and the upper respiratory airway unobstructed. Secondly, an initial flow of 60 L/min and 37 should be given immediately for patients with obvious respiratory distress or weak cough ability; otherwise, low-level support should be given first and the level gradually increased. Thirdly, to avoid hypoxia or hypoxemia, the treatment goal of HFNC should be maintained the oxygen saturation (SpO2) above 95% for patients without chronic pulmonary disease. Finally, patients should wear a surgical mask during HFNC treatment to reduce the risk of virus transmission through droplets or aerosols.","Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban","He, Guojun","Han, Yijiao","Fang, Qiang","Zhou, Jianying","Shen, Jifang","Li, Tong","Pu, Qibing","Chen, Aijun","Qi, Zhiyang","Sun, Lijun","Cai, Hongliu","32268019"],"abstract":["Acute respiratory failure due to acute hypoxemia is the major manifestation in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.
