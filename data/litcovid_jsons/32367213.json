Case Report: A fifty-year-old female patient, who is a businesswoman, presented with chief complaints of \"fever for one week, diarrhea, anorexia, and asthenia.\" Initially, she was given Tamiflu. The influenza A virus serology was negative. Three days later, levofloxacin was started because the patient's symptoms did not improve. The novel coronavirus nucleic acid test was negative. It was noted that before the onset of the disease, the patient went to Wuhan on a business trip.
