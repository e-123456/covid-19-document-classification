METHODS: Patient data were obtained from medical records from the University Hospital \"12 de Octubre,\" Madrid, Spain. RESULTS: Three patients (2 men, and one woman, aged 63-88) presented with mild hypersomnia and generalized myoclonus following the onset of the so-called \"inflammatory\" phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). All of them had presented previously with anosmia. Myoclonus had a stereotypical pattern, being both positive and negative, generalized, with a predominant involvement of nasopharyngeal, facial, and upper limbs areas. These jerky movements occurred spontaneously and were extremely sensitive to multisensory stimuli (auditive and tactile) or voluntary movement, with an exaggerated startle response. Other causes of myoclonus were ruled-out, and none of them had undergone respiratory arrest or significant prolonged hypoxia. All of them improved, at least partially, with immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our 3 cases highlight the occurrence of myoclonus during the COVID-19 pandemic as a postinfectious/immune-mediated disorder. However, we cannot rule out that SARS-CoV-2 may spread transneuronally to first- and second-order structures connected with the olfactory bulb. Further investigation is required to clarify the full clinical spectrum of neurologic symptoms and its optimal treatment.","Neurology","Rabano-Suarez, Pablo","Bermejo-Guerrero, Laura","Mendez-Guerrero, Antonio","Parra-Serrano, Javier","Toledo-Alfocea, Daniel","Sanchez-Tejerina, Daniel","Santos-Fernandez, Teresa","Folgueira-Lopez, Maria Dolores","Gutierrez-Gutierrez, Judit","Ayuso-Garcia, Blanca","Gonzalez de la Aleja, Jesus","Benito-Leon, Julian","32439821"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: To report 3 patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) who developed generalized myoclonus.

Data on AIDP-patients associated with SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus-2) infection are scarce. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 54-years-old Caucasian female patient with typical clinical and electrophysiological manifestations of AIDP, who was reported positive with PCR for SARS-CoV-2, three weeks prior to onset of the neurological symptoms. She did not experience a preceding fever or respiratory symptoms, but a transient loss of smell and taste. At the admission to our neurological department, a progressive proximally pronounced paraparesis, areflexia and sensory loss with tingling of all extremities were found, which began ten days before. The modified Erasmus Giullain-Barre Syndrome outcome score (mEGOS) was 3/9 at admission and 1/12 at day 7 of hospitalization. The electrophysiological assessment proved a segmental demyelinating polyneuropathy and cerebrospinal fluid examination showed an albuminocytologic dissociation. The neurological symptoms improved significantly during treatment with immunoglobulins. INTERPRETATION: Our case draws attention to the occurrence of GBS also in patients with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), who did not experience respiratory or general symptoms. It emphasizes that SARS-CoV-2 induces immunological processes, regardless from the lack of prodromic symptoms. However, it is likely that there is a connection between the severity of the respiratory syndrome and further neurological consequences. This article is protected by copyright.
