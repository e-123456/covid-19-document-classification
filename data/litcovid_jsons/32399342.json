She was suspected of having COVID-19, since there was a confirmed COVID-19 case near her residence. But she had no fever, cough, chest tightness, difficult breathing, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, etc. On physical examination, the lower posterior chest of both sides showed dullness on percussion and moist rales at the end of inspiration on auscultation. The white blood cell count and lymphocyte count were 10.88 x 10(9)/L and 1.04 x 10(9)/L, respectively.
