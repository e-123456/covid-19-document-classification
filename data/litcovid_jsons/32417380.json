The mean (+/-SD) age of patients was 61+/-12 years, 100% were black males, and symptoms began 6+/-4 days before admission. The most common symptoms included subjective fever (92%), shortness of breath (85%), and cough (77%). Six (46%) required admission to the intensive care unit. Two patients (15%) died during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Black men may be at increased risk for Covid-19 among patients with OHT.
