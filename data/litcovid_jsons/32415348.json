Cholesteatoma is known for its potential to cause complications and scheduling of surgery during the pandemic must be done carefully. The majority of otological surgeries may be classified as elective and postponed at this time (e.g., stapedotomy, tympanoplasty); whereas, others are emergencies (e.g., complicated acute otitis media, complicated cholesteatoma with cerebral or Bezold's abscess, meningitis, sinus thrombosis) and require immediate intervention. What is the ideal time for the surgical management of Cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic? METHODS: Senior otologic surgeons from six teaching hospitals from various countries affected by the COVID-19 from around the world met remotely to make recommendations on reorganizing schedules for the treatment of cholesteatoma which has a risk of severe morbidity and mortality. The recommendations are based on their experiences and on available literature. RESULTS: Due to the high risk of infecting the surgical staff it is prudent to stop all elective ear surgeries and plan cholesteatoma surgery after careful selection of patients, based on the extent of the disease and available resources. Specific precautions including use of appropriate personal protection equipment should be followed when operating on all patients during the pandemic. To facilitate the decision-making in the management of cholesteatoma, timing for surgery can be divided into two categories with 3 and 2 sub-groups based on disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence on the timing of surgery of patients with cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking.

Otolaryngologists caring for children commonly depend on physical examination, laboratory data, and ambulatory surgical procedures. Limiting patient care, mindful allocation of resources, and concern for safety have challenged all aspects of our health care system. This evidence-based clinical consensus is designed to guide practitioners of pediatric otolaryngology for common scenarios during this time. DATA SOURCES: Peer-reviewed literature, published reports, institutional guidelines, and expert consensus. REVIEW METHODS: A clinical consensus on 6 common scenarios in pediatric otolaryngology developed with evidence-based strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Providers should suspend all in-person nonessential office visits and elective surgical procedures. An emphasis on medical management and caregiver education will provide reasonable approaches to many of the common outpatient concerns. Surgery for chronic otitis media, obstructive sleep apnea, and acute rhinosinusitis should occur only in response to severe complications or failure of medical regimens. The approach to the pediatric neck mass focuses on timely management for oncologic etiologies and cautious surgical intervention for abscess drainage or tissue sampling. Finally, epistaxis and otorrhea must be triaged and addressed without the usual ambulatory procedures. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Adaptation of practice patterns during this unprecedented moment for our health care system requires thoughtful planning. The strategies described allow for safe handling of common pediatric otolaryngology diagnoses. Ultimately, otolaryngologists must be stewards of our global health community while advocating for the care of individual pediatric patients.","Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg","Chorney, Stephen R","Elden, Lisa M","Giordano, Terri","Kazahaya, Ken","Rizzi, Mark D","Zur, Karen B","Dedhia, Kavita","32423296"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires clinicians to explore alternatives to routine patient management.
