The vast majority of hip and knee arthroplasty surgery does not meet the definition of essential surgery. This study estimated the number of arthroplasty procedures that would be canceled because of these important restrictions. METHODS: The US hip and knee arthroplasty procedure volume projections for 2020 were estimated from four recently published studies. Data from the American Joint Replacement Registry were utilized to determine what percentage of these cases would be considered nonessential surgery. Monthly and weekly estimates of nonessential hip and knee arthroplasty procedures that would have occurred had there not been any restrictions due to COVID-19 were calculated. RESULTS: After excluding essential procedures, it was estimated that approximately 30,000 primary and 3000 revision hip and knee arthroplasty procedures will be canceled each week while COVID-19 restrictions regarding nonessential surgery are in place. If only 50% of nonessential cases were actually canceled across the United States, that would still result in the cancellation of 15,001 primary and 1435 revision hip and knee arthroplasty procedures per week while restrictions are in place. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the profound impact COVID-19 is having on our current hip and knee arthroplasty volume.

The aim of this paper is to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hip and knee arthroplasties in an Italian high-volume orthopedic center, located in the region of the country first and worst affected by the Coronavirus. METHODS: Data from an institutional database were retrospectively analyzed to obtain the number of hip and knee arthroplasties performed from February 24 to April 10 2020. The figures were compared with those of the same 7-week period of the last year (2019). RESULTS: The number of hip and knee arthroplasties showed a decrease from 706 in the same period of 2019 to 166 (76.5% less) in the current year. In 2019, a mean of 101 +/- 9 hip and knee arthroplasties were performed per week compared with a mean of 24 +/- 34 in 2020. Ten patients tested positive for SARS-CoV2 during their hospital stay.

RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus currently presenting in the form of a global pandemic, referred to as COVID-19. In this setting, multiple states have issued executive orders prohibiting \"elective\" surgery, including arthroplasty, in order to preserve healthcare resources. However, during this unprecedented reduction in elective surgery, there is likely to be some controversy as to what constitutes a purely \"elective\" procedure, versus an \"urgent\" procedure, particularly regarding hip arthroplasty. We reviewed the available literature for articles discussing the most commonly encountered indications for primary, conversion, and revision hip arthroplasty. Based upon the indications discussed in these articles, we further stratified these indications into \"elective\" versus \"urgent\" categories. In patients presenting with hip arthroplasty indications, the decision to proceed urgently with surgery should be based upon (a) the potential harm incurred by the patient if the surgery was delayed and (b) the potential risk incurred by the patient in the context of COVID-19 if surgery was performed. The authors present a decision-making algorithm for determining surgical urgency in three patients who underwent surgery in this context. Urgent total hip arthroplasty in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic is a complex decision-making process, involving clinical and epidemiological factors.
