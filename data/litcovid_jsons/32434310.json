METHODS: We conducted a proportion meta-analysis to integrate the results of previous studies identified in online databases, and subsequently compared the overlapping of 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between locations of diagnosis. The heterogeneity of the results of the included studies was also demonstrated. RESULTS: Nine studies with level IV evidence were considered to be eligible for the meta-analysis, and a comparative analysis was only possible between patients diagnosed in Wuhan and outside of Wuhan in China. Fever (84.8%; 95% CI, 78.5% to 90.1%) was identified as the most common clinical manifestation in all COVID-19 patients, and signs of respiratory infection were also frequently present in these patients. When comparing the clinical features according to the location of diagnosis, fever and dyspnea were less frequent in patients diagnosed outside of Wuhan (fever: 78.1%; 95% CI, 73.2% to 82.7%; dyspnea: 3.80%; 95% CI, 0.13% to 12.22%) than in patients diagnosed in Wuhan (fever: 91.7%; 95% CI, 88.0% to 94.8%; dyspnea: 21.1%; 95% CI, 13.2% to 30.3%). The chest CT findings exhibited no significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSION: Fever was found to be the most common symptom in COVID-19, and respiratory infection signs were also commonly present. Fever and dyspnea were less frequently observed in the patients diagnosed outside of Wuhan, which should be considered in COVID-19 screening programs. These results may be attributable to the earlier diagnosis of the disease and the younger age of patients outside of Wuhan although further analysis is needed.

METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science through February 25, 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. RESULTS: Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 1 576 infected patients. The results showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever (91.3%, 95% CI: 86-97%), followed by cough (67.7%, 95% CI: 59-76%), fatigue (51.0%, 95% CI: 34-68%) and dyspnea (30.4%, 95% CI: 21-40%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (21.1%, 95% CI: 13.0-27.2%) and diabetes (9.7%, 95% CI: 7.2-12.2%), followed by cardiovascular disease (8.4%, 95% CI: 3.8-13.8%) and respiratory system disease (1.5%, 95% CI: 0.9-2.1%). When compared between severe and non-severe patients, the pooled OR of hypertension, respiratory system disease, and cardiovascular disease were 2.36 (95% CI: 1.46-3.83), 2.46 (95% CI: 1.76-3.44) and 3.42 (95% CI: 1.88-6.22) respectively. CONCLUSION: We assessed the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 patients and found that underlying disease, including hypertension, respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease, may be risk factors for severe patients compared with non-severe patients."],"journal":"Int J Infect Dis","authors":["Yang, Jing","Zheng, Ya","Gou, Xi","Pu, Ke","Chen, Zhaofeng","Guo, Qinghong","Ji, Rui","Wang, Haojia","Wang, Yuping","Zhou, Yongning"],"date":"2020-03-17T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32173574","source":"PubMed","week":"202012|Mar 16 - Mar 22","doi":"10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.017","keywords":["covid-19","clinical characteristics","comorbidities","epidemiology","meta-analysis","sars-cov-2"],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"weight":0,"_version_":1666138492594290689,"score":238.28653}]}
