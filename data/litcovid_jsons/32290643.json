METHODS: Analyze the surrounding environment, ward layout, area management, treatment process, medical staff and patient management of the designated community hospital. RESULTS: From February 5, 2020, to February 18, 2020, the designated community hospital has received 198 COVID-19 mild and general patients (including 41 in the hospital at the beginning of the period).
