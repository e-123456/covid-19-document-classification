Aims: to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Gastroenterology Divisions across Italy. Methods: All members of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology (SIGE) were invited to answer a web-based survey. Results: Data of 121 hospitals from all 20 Italian regions were analyzed. Overall, 10.7% Gastroenterology Divisions have been converted to Covid Units. Outpatients consultations, endoscopic and ultrasound procedures were limited to urgencies and oncology indications in 85.1%, 96.2% and 72.2% of Units, respectively, and 46.7% of them suspended the screening for colorectal cancer.Moreover, 72.2% of the staff received a training for use of personal protective equipment, although 45.5% did not have sufficient devices for adequate replacement. Overall, 132 healthcare workers in 41 Gastroenterology Divisions were found to be infected. Conclusion: This is the first study to evaluate, at a country level, the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on Gastroenterology Divisions. Substantial changes of practice and reduction of procedures have been recorded in the entire country. The long-term impact of such modifications is difficult to estimate but potentially very risky for many digestive diseases.","Dig Liver Dis","Maida, M","Sferrazza, S","Savarino, E","Ricciardiello, L","Repici, A","Morisco, F","Furnari, M","Fuccio, L","Morreale, G C","Vitello, A","Burra, P","Marchi, S","Annibale, B","Benedetti, A","Alvaro, D","Ianiro, G","32425733"],"abstract":["Background: In Italy, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed the entire healthcare system and required a huge re-organization of many Divisions, including those of Gastroenterology.

The Training Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) sought to understand how COVID-19 has affected pediatric gastroenterology fellowship training. METHODS: A 21 question survey was distributed to all 77 pediatric gastroenterology fellowship program directors (PDs) in the NASPGHAN program director database via email on April 7. Responses collected through April 19, 2020 were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 51/77 (66%) PDs from the United States, Canada and Mexico responded to the survey. 46/51 (90%) PDs reported that they were under a \"stay-at-home\" order for a median of 4 weeks at the time of the survey. 2/51 (4%) programs had fellows participating in outpatient telehealth prior to COVID-19 and 39/51 (76%) at the time of the survey. Fellows stopped participating in outpatient clinics in 22/51 (43%) programs and endoscopy in 26/51 (52%) programs. Changes to inpatient care included reduced fellow staffing, limiting who entered patient rooms, and rounding remotely. Fellows in 3 New York programs were deployed to adult medicine units.
