OBJECTIVE: Due to an urgent need for a tool which would make it possible to present important reports, and which would be based on valid data sources only, a team of government experts together with researchers focused on the design and development of a web application intended to provide a regularly updated overview of COVID-19 epidemiology in the Czech Republic to the general public. METHODS: The CRISP-DM (CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) standardized methodology for knowledge mining from database structures was chosen for the complex solution of analytical processing and visualization of data, which provides validated information on the COVID-19 epidemic across the Czech Republic. Great emphasis was put on the understanding and a correct implementation of all six steps (business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation and deployment) needed in the process, including the infrastructure of a nationwide information system, the methodological setting of communication channels between all involved stakeholders, as well as data collection, processing, analysis, validation and visualization.
