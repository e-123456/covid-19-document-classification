This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the rapid scoring system on admission of these patients. METHODS: 138 medical records of critical ill patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics on admission used for calculating Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) and outcomes (survival or death) were collected for each case and extracted for analysis. All patients were divided into two age subgroups (<65 and >/=65years). The receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed for overall patients and both subgroups. RESULTS: The median [25%quartile, 75%quartile] of MEWS of survivors versus non-survivors were 1[1, 2] and 2[1, 3] and that of REMS were 5[2, 6] and 7[6, 10], respectively. In overall analysis, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the REMS in predicting mortality was 0.833 (95% CI: 0.737-0.928), higher than that of MEWS (0.677, 95% CI 0.541-0.813). An optimal cut-off of REMS (>/=6) had a sensitivity of 89.5%, a specificity of 69.8%, a positive predictive value of 39.5%, and a negative predictive value of 96.8%.

The present study aimed to analyze the characteristics of severe COVID-19 and identify biomarkers for differential diagnosis and prognosis prediction. METHODS: In total, 27 consecutive patients with COVID-19 and 75 patients with flu were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical parameters were collected from electronic medical records. The disease course was divided into four stages: initial, progression, peak, and recovery stages, according to computed tomography (CT) progress. RESULTS: Compared to mild COVID-19, the lymphocytes in the severe COVID-19 progressively decreased at the progression and the peak stages, but rebound in the recovery stage. The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the severe group at the initial and progression stages were higher than those in the mild group.

Demographic, clinical, laboratory information, especially T lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines were reported. For patients who died or discharge from hospital, the associations of T lymphocyte subsets on admission were evaluated by univariate logistic regression with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), warning values to predict in-hospital death were assessed by Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves.

All patients exhibited a significant drop of T lymphocyte subsets counts with remarkably increasing concentrations of SAA, CRP, IL-6, and IL-10 compared to normal values.
