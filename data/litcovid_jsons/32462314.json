As of April 23, 2020, 2.7 million cases have been confirmed, over 190,000 people are dead, and about 750,000 people are reported recovered. Yet, there is no publicly available data on tests that could be missing infections. Complicating matters and furthering anxiety are specific instances of false-negative tests. METHODS: We developed a deep learning model to improve accuracy of reported cases and to precisely predict the disease from chest X-ray scans. Our model relied on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect structural abnormalities and disease categorization that were keys to uncovering hidden patterns. To do so, a transfer learning approach was deployed to perform detections from the chest anterior-posterior radiographs of patients. We used publicly available datasets to achieve this. RESULTS: Our results offer very high accuracy (96.3%) and loss (0.151 binary cross-entropy) using the public dataset consisting of patients from different countries worldwide. As the confusion matrix indicates, our model is able to accurately identify true negatives (74) and true positives (32); this deep learning model identified three cases of false-positive and one false-negative finding from the healthy patient scans. CONCLUSIONS: Our COVID-19 detection model minimizes manual interaction dependent on radiologists as it automates identification of structural abnormalities in patient's CXRs, and our deep learning model is likely to detect true positives and true negatives and weed out false positive and false negatives with > 96.3% accuracy.","Int Orthop","Vaid, Shashank","Kalantar, Reza","Bhandari, Mohit","32462314"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Detection of COVID-19 cases' accuracy is posing a conundrum for scientists, physicians, and policy-makers.

Methods: Deep Learning has proven to be a remarkable method to extract massive high-dimensional features from medical images.

A large-scale dataset of 3905 X-ray images, corresponding to 6 diseases, is utilized for training MobileNet v2, which has been proven to achieve excellent results in related tasks. Results: Training the CNNs from scratch outperforms the other transfer learning techniques, both in distinguishing the X-rays between the seven classes and between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19. A classification accuracy between the seven classes of 87.66% is achieved. Besides, this method achieves 99.18% accuracy, 97.36% Sensitivity, and 99.42% Specificity in the detection of COVID-19.

Radiology serves as an adjunct to the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test for confirmation and evaluating disease progression.

CXR imaging is commonly used in high-demand situations, placing a significant burden on radiology services. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has been suggested to alleviate this burden. However, there is a dearth of sufficient training data for developing image-based AI tools.

We expand the training data distribution for supervised learning through the use of weakly labeled CXR images, automatically pooled from publicly available pneumonia datasets, to classify them into those with bacterial or viral pneumonia opacities.
