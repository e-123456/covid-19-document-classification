This topic is currently arousing great interest, and a growing number of papers are being published. Aim of this study is to investigate the timing of recovery from OD and GD in a real-life population hospitalized for COVID-19. METHODS: We followed up by a phone interview the first 100 patients discharged a month earlier from three Italian non-intensive care wards. RESULTS: All 100 patients were Caucasian, mean age was 65 years, 60% were males. Forty-two patients (mean age 63 years) experienced subjective chemosensory dysfunctions (29 OD and 41 GD): the male/female ratio was 2:1; 83% reported a complete or near complete recovery at follow-up. The recovery rate was not significantly different between males and females. The mean duration of OD and GD was 18 and 16 days, respectively. The mean recovery time from OD or GD resulted significantly longer for females than for males (26 vs 14 days, P = 0.009). Among the 42 symptomatic, the mean age of males was significantly higher than that of females (66 vs 57 years, P = 0.04), while the opposite was observed in the 58 asymptomatic patients (60 vs 73 years, P = 0.0018). CONCLUSIONS: Recovery from OD or GD was rapid, occurring within 4 weeks in most patients. Chemosensory dysfunctions in women was less frequent, but longer lasting. The value of our study is its focus on a population of hospitalized patients significantly older than those previously described, and the additional data on gender differences.","Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol","Meini, Simone","Suardi, Lorenzo Roberto","Busoni, Michele","Roberts, Anna Teresa","Fortini, Alberto","32500326"],"abstract":["PURPOSE: COVID-19 displays a variety of clinical manifestations; in pauci-symptomatic patients olfactory (OD) and gustatory dysfunctions (GD) may represent the first or only symptom.

RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus currently presenting in the form of a global pandemic, referred to as COVID-19. In this setting, multiple states have issued executive orders prohibiting \"elective\" surgery, including arthroplasty, in order to preserve healthcare resources. However, during this unprecedented reduction in elective surgery, there is likely to be some controversy as to what constitutes a purely \"elective\" procedure, versus an \"urgent\" procedure, particularly regarding hip arthroplasty. We reviewed the available literature for articles discussing the most commonly encountered indications for primary, conversion, and revision hip arthroplasty. Based upon the indications discussed in these articles, we further stratified these indications into \"elective\" versus \"urgent\" categories. In patients presenting with hip arthroplasty indications, the decision to proceed urgently with surgery should be based upon (a) the potential harm incurred by the patient if the surgery was delayed and (b) the potential risk incurred by the patient in the context of COVID-19 if surgery was performed. The authors present a decision-making algorithm for determining surgical urgency in three patients who underwent surgery in this context. Urgent total hip arthroplasty in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic is a complex decision-making process, involving clinical and epidemiological factors. These decisions are best made in coordination with a multidisciplinary committee of one's peers. Region-specific issues such as hospital resources and availability of PPE may also inform the decision-making process.","Curr Rev Musculoskelet Med","Rizkalla, James M","Gladnick, Brian P","Bhimani, Aamir A","Wood, Dorian S","Kitziger, Kurt J","Peters, Paul C Jr","32444993"],"abstract":["PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review was to evaluate the available literature to determine what may be considered urgent indications for total hip arthroplasty, in the unprecedented setting of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.
