The indications for renal replacement therapy for these patients are those commonly accepted to treat AKI. We describe a continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD) protocol for AKI, which aims to provide the best treatment according to the particular patient's and medical personnels' needs in biohazard settings with limited human and technological resources. We designed a CVVHD protocol with a high cut-off (HCO) filter in regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA). The HCO filter in diffusion determines the enhanced cytokines clearance with less filter clotting due to a lower filtration fraction. In our hospital, at the beginning of the pandemic outbreak, we treated seven COVID-19 patients with AKI stage 2 and 3 and recorded the circuit lifespan and the number of interventions on monitors. CVVHD in RCA appears to be safe, effective and easy to be performed in a biohazard scenario using lower blood flows and less bag changes with fluid savings, a biohazard reduction and sparing of resources. Although the data come from a very small cohort, our protocol seems related to a low mortality.","J Clin Med","Nalesso, Federico","Garzotto, Francesco","Cattarin, Leda","Gobbi, Laura","Qassim, Laila","Sgarabotto, Luca","Tiberio, Ivo","Calo, Lorenzo A","32438617"],"abstract":["COVID-19 often leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI).
