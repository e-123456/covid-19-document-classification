OBJECTIVE: To retrieve and investigate the prevention and control measures of clinical pharmacists during the outbreak of novel coronavirus, summarize the roles and responsibilities of clinical pharmacists, and to propose innovative strategies for developing pharmacy services under the epidemic. METHODS: The Chinese and English databases, self-media network, website of professional society or medical institution, and clinical trial center platforms were searched, and clinical pharmacists involved in the work against COVID-19 were surveyed and interviewed. Investigate the challenges and needs of frontline medical staffs for treating patients, and formulate strategies based on the actual medical environment. RESULTS: Clinical pharmacists play a vital role in leading the industry to formulate work instructions, provide frontline medical staff with drug information, and develop innovative pharmacy services to promote the rational use of medicines with collaborative teamwork and close communication according to the epidemic situation of COVID-19. Anti-epidemic work indeed has driven the development of remote pharmacy services. CONCLUSION: Facing public health emergencies, clinical pharmacists can give full play to their professional expertise, analyze the current situation rationally, formulate telehealth strategies swiftly, and work in a united and efficient manner to provide innovative pharmacy services to ensure medication safety and rational use of medicine.","Res Social Adm Pharm","Li, Huibo","Zheng, Siqian","Liu, Fang","Liu, Wei","Zhao, Rongsheng","32278766"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Clinical pharmacists' routine task is carrying out pharmaceutical care to ensure patients' safe and reasonable medication use.
