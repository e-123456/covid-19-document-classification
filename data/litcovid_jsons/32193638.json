The number of affected lobes, ground glass nodules (GGO), patchy/punctate ground glass opacities, patchy consolidation, fibrous stripes and irregular solid nodules in each patient's chest CT image were recorded. Additionally, we performed imaging follow-up of these patients. RESULTS: CT images of 63 confirmed patients were collected. M/F ratio: 33/30. The mean age was 44.9 +/- 15.2 years. The mean number of affected lobes was 3.3 +/- 1.8. Nineteen (30.2%) patients had one affected lobe, five (7.9%) patients had two affected lobes, four (6.3%) patients had three affected lobes, seven (11.1%) patients had four affected lobes while 28 (44.4%) patients had 5 affected lobes.

We aimed to report the imaging and clinical characteristics of these patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: All patients with laboratory-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were collected between January 23, 2020, and February 4, 2020, in a designated hospital (Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital). This analysis included 90 patients (39 men and 51 women; median age, 50 years (age range, 18-86 years).

MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study from January 19 through February 6, 2020. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. RESULTS. Eleven patients had RT-PCR test results that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas 22 patients had negative results.
