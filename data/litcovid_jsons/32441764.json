PARPi's can effectively decrease IL-6, IL-1 and TNFalpha levels (key interleukins in SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm) and can alleviate subsequent lung fibrosis, as demonstrated in murine experiments and clinical trials. PARPi can tune macrophages towards a tolerogenic phenotype. PARPi's may also counteract SARS-CoV-2-induced and inflammation-induced cell death and support cell survival. PARPi's had beneficial effects in animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), asthma and ventilator-induced lung injury. PARPi's may potentiate the effectiveness of Tocilizumab, Anakinra, Sarilumab, Adalimumab, Canakinumab or Siltuximab therapy. In summary, the evidence suggests that PARPi therapy would benefit COVID-19 patients and trials of these drugs should be undertaken.","Br J Pharmacol","Curtin, Nicola","Banyai, Krisztian","Thaventhiran, James","Le Quesne, John","Helyes, Zsuzsanna","Bai, Peter","32441764"],"abstract":["Clinically approved PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have a mild adverse effect profile and are well-tolerated as continuous daily oral therapy.
