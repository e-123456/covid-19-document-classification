This study analyzed obesity as an independent risk factor for mortality in hospitalized patients younger than fifty. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of COVID-19 patients hospitalized to a large academic hospital system in New York City between March 1st and May 17th, 2020. Data included demographics, comorbidities, BMI and smoking status. Obesity groups included: BMI 30-40 kg/m(2) and BMI >/= 40 kg/m(2) . Multivariable logistic regression models identified variables independently associated with mortality in patients younger and older than 50. RESULTS: Overall, 3,406 patients were included. 572 (17.0%) of the patients were younger than 50. In the younger age group, 60 (10.5%) patients died. In the older age group, 1,076 (38.0%) patients died. For the younger population, BMI above 40 kg/m(2) was independently associated with mortality (aOR 5.1, 95% CI 2.3-11.1).
