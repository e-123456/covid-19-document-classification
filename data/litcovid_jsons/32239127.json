In this study, we investigate clinical and laboratory features and short-term outcomes of patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19). METHODS: All patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 3 and February 1, 2020 were included. All those patients were with laboratory-confirmed infection. Epidemiological, clinical, radiological characteristics, underlying diseases, laboratory tests treatment, complications and outcomes data were collected. Outcomes were followed up at discharge until Feb 15, 2020. RESULTS: The study cohort included 102 adult patients. The median (IQR) age was 54 years (37-67years) and 48.0% were female. A total of 34 patients (33.3%) were exposed to source of transmission in the hospital setting (as health care workers, patients, or visitors) and 10 patients (9.8%) had a familial cluster. Eighteen patients (17.6%) were admitted to the ICU, and 17 patients died (mortality, 16.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.4%-23.9%). Among patients who survived, they were younger, more likely were health care workers and less likely suffered from comorbidities. They were also less likely suffered from complications. There was no difference in drug treatment rates between the survival and non-survival groups. Patients who survived less likely required admission to the intensive care unit (14.1% vs. 35.3%). Chest imaging examination showed that death patients more likely had ground-glass opacity (41.2% vs. 12.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate was high among the COVID-19 patients described in our cohort who met our criteria for inclusion in this analysis. Patient characteristics seen more frequently in those who died were development of systemic complications following onset of the illness and the severity of disease requiring admission to the ICU. Our data support those described by others that COVID-19 infection results from human-to-human transmission, including familial clustering of cases, and nosocomial transmission. There were no differences in mortality among those who did or did not receive antimicrobial or glucocorticoid drug treatment.","Clin Infect Dis","Cao, Jianlei","Tu, Wen-Jun","Cheng, Wenlin","Yu, Lei","Liu, Ya-Kun","Hu, Xiaoyong","Liu, Qiang","32239127"],"abstract":["OBJECTIVE: In December, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China.

Results: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]).

Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days.

We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.

Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. FINDINGS: By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49.0 years (IQR 41.0-58.0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).

COVID-19 cases in children aged <3 years, 3.6 years, and >/=6-years patients were 10 (40%), 6 (24%), and 9 (36%), respectively. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (13 [52%]), and dry cough (11 [44%]). Chest CT images showed essential normal in 8 cases (33.3%), unilateral involvement of lungs in 5 cases (20.8%), and bilateral involvement in 11 cases (45.8%). Clinical diagnoses included upper respiratory tract infection (n=8), mild pneumonia (n=15), and critical cases (n=2). Two critical cases (8%) were given invasive mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, and immunoglobulin. The symptoms in 24 (96%) of 25 patients were alleviated and one patient had been discharged. It was concluded that children were susceptible to COVID-19 like adults, while the clinical presentations and outcomes were more favorable in children. However, children less than 3 years old accounted for majority cases and critical cases lied in this age group, which demanded extra attentions during home caring and hospitalization treatment."],"journal":"Curr Med Sci","authors":["Zheng, Fang","Liao, Chun","Fan, Qi-Hong","Chen, Hong-Bo","Zhao, Xue-Gong","Xie, Zhong-Guo","Li, Xi-Lin","Chen, Chun-Xi","Lu, Xiao-Xia","Liu, Zhi-Sheng","Lu, Wei","Chen, Chun-Bao","Jiao, Rong","Zhang, Ai-Ming","Wang, Jin-Tang","Ding, Xi-Wei","Zeng, Yao-Guang","Cheng, Li-Ping","Huang, Qing-Feng","Wu, Jiang","Luo, Xi-Chang","Wang, Zhu-Jun","Zhong, Yan-Yan","Bai, Yan","Wu, Xiao-Yan","Jin, Run-Ming"],"date":"2020-03-25T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32207032","week":"202013|Mar 23 - Mar 29","doi":"10.1007/s11596-020-2172-6","keywords":["COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2","children","coronavirus"],"source":"PubMed","locations":["China","Hubei"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"topics":["Diagnosis"],"weight":1,"_version_":1663095625847144448,"score":165.1011},{"pmid":32075786,"title":"Clinical findings in a group of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) outside of Wuhan, China: retrospective case series.","text":["Clinical findings in a group of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) outside of Wuhan, China: retrospective case series.","OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics of patients in Zhejiang province, China, infected with the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-2019). DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Seven hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. PARTICIPANTS: 62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection.

RESULTS: Of the 62 patients studied (median age 41 years), only one was admitted to an intensive care unit, and no patients died during the study. According to research, none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province were ever exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the original source of the virus; all studied cases were infected by human to human transmission.
