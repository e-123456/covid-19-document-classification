Herein, we have reviewed the two-way interactions between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus.

RESULTS: Compromised innate immunity, pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu, reduced expression of ACE2 and use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists in people with diabetes mellitus contribute to poor prognosis in COVID-19. On the contrary, direct beta-cell damage, cytokine-induced insulin resistance, hypokalemia and drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 (like corticosteroids, lopinavir/ritonavir) can contribute to worsening of glucose control in people with diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: The two-way interaction between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus sets up a vicious cycle wherein COVID-19 leads to worsening of dysglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in turn, exacerbates the severity of COVID-19. Thus, it is imperative that people with diabetes mellitus take all necessary precautions and ensure good glycemic control amid the ongoing pandemic.","Diabetes Metab Syndr","Pal, Rimesh","Bhadada, Sanjay K","32388331"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diabetes mellitus is associated with poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19.
