METHODS: A retrospective study was applied for descriptive analysis on clinical features and epidemiological factors of confirmed cases in four cities of Zhejiang. Onset-admission interval was calculated and plotted as well. The provincial measures regarding to the response of COVID-19 were summed up and sorted out. RESULTS: The distribution and sex and age were under normality distribution, and age of 20 to 80 were all in a risk of developing the disease. Clinical features of fever and cough were found mostly happen on patients. More than half of the patients had image changed on chest from reported data. The factor of closely contacted with confirmed cases was the most cause to the disease. The median onset-admission interval was 6 days in Zhejiang province.
