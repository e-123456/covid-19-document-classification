However, persons at greatest risk for poor mental health outcomes, such as persons with serious mental illness, have been largely overlooked. OBJECTIVE: To examine the mental health impact of COVID-19 and social distancing behaviors among persons with serious mental illness and the behaviors taken to prevent COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Participants will include individuals with serious mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) and non-psychiatric control participants who are currently or previously participated in several ongoing parent observational studies. Data will be collected from April, 2020 through August, 2020. Participants will complete phone interviews at two time points to assess their current emotional functioning and measures they have taken to prevent COVID-19 infection. Baseline (pre-COVID-19) mental health, sampled by ecological momentary assessment over an extended period, will be compared with current mental health, sampled by ecological momentary assessment over an extended period, and demographic, cognitive and psychosocial factors at baseline will be used to examine risk and resilience to current mental health and coping. RESULTS: Study results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. CONCLUSIONS: Findings have broad implications for understanding the psychological consequences of COVID-19 among vulnerable persons with serious mental illness, and will provide the opportunity to identify targets to reduce negative outcomes in the future. We also hope our efforts will provide a roadmap and resources for other researchers who would like to implement a similar approach.

However, few studies have examined sleep problems, depression, and posttraumatic symptoms among the general adult population during the COVID-19 outbreak, and little is known about coping behaviors. This survey was conducted online in China from February 1st to February 10th, 2020. Quota sampling was used to recruit 2993 Chinese citizens aged >/=18 years old. Mental health problems were assessed with the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD) Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression inventory, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Exposure to COVID-19 was measured with questions about residence at outbreak, personal exposure, media exposure, and impact on livelihood. General coping style was measured by the brief Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). Respondents were also asked 12 additional questions about COVID-19 specific coping behaviors. Direct exposure to COVID-19 instead of the specific location of (temporary) residence within or outside the epicenter (Wuhan) of the pandemic seems important (standardized beta: 0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02-0.09). Less mental health problems were also associated with less intense exposure through the media (standardized beta: -0.07, 95% CI: -0.10--0.03). Perceived negative impact of the pandemic on livelihood showed a large effect size in predicting mental health problems (standardized beta: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.10-0.19). More use of cognitive and prosocial coping behaviors were associated with less mental health problems (standardized beta: -0.30, 95% CI: -0.34--0.27). Our study suggests that the mental health consequences of the lockdown impact on livelihood should not be underestimated.
