The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current evidence surrounding the treatment of these patients during this pandemic and to provide evidence-based recommendations with attention to increased risk in this setting. DATA SOURCES: A review of the literature was performed with PubMed. Because recently published articles on this topic may not yet be indexed into PubMed, otolaryngology journals were hand searched for relevant articles. Guidelines from national organizations were reviewed to identify additional relevant sources of information. REVIEW METHODS: Two groups of search terms were created: one with terms related to COVID-19 and another with terms related to head and neck cancer and its management. Searches were performed of all terms in each group as well as combinations of terms between groups. Searches and subsequent exclusion of articles were performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses). Additional articles were identified after relevant journals and guidelines from national organizations were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with head and neck mucosal malignancy require continued treatment despite the current pandemic state. Care must be taken at all stages of treatment to minimize the risk to patients and health care workers while maintaining focus on minimizing use of limited resources.

We aim to review the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of head and neck cancer, with an emphasis on the role of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) during a pandemic. DATA SOURCES: COVID-19 resources from PubMed, Google Scholar, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, and the American Head and Neck Society were examined. REVIEW METHODS: Studies and guidelines related to the multidisciplinary management of head and neck cancer in the COVID-19 setting were reviewed. A total of 54 studies were included. Given the continuously evolving body of literature, the sources cited include the latest statements from medical and dental societies. RESULTS: The unpredictable fluctuation of hospital resources and the risk of the nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2 have direct effects on head and neck cancer management. Using an MDT approach to help define \"essential surgery\" for immediately life- or function-threatening disease processes in the context of available hospital resources will help to maximize outcomes. Early enrollment in an MDT is often critical for considering nonsurgical options to protect patients and health care workers. The role of the MDT continues after cancer treatment, if delivered, and the MDT plays an essential role in surveillance and survivorship programs in these challenging times.
