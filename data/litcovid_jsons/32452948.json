METHODS: To facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect.

We implemented an SEIR metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic simulations. RESULTS: Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which, although might not be sufficient for disease eradication, would produce as a second order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Many quantitative aspects of the natural history of the disease are still unknown, such as the amount of possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. However, preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be ready for quick and efficacious deployment globally. The scenarios evaluated here through data-driven simulations indicate that measures aimed at reducing individuals' flow are much less effective than others intended for early case identification and isolation.

Data mining and association network were used to mine the high-frequency herbs and formulas from ancient prescriptions. Virtual screening for the effective components of high frequency CMs and compatibility Chinese Medicine was explored by a molecular docking approach.

Epidemiologist has shown that the mortality risks are higher when the health care system falls under the COVID19 pressure. It is, therefore, of great importance to keep health care providers (HCP) healthy and prevent contamination. An important group who will be confronted with the treatment of COVID19 positive patients are HCP during (semi) acute surgery. There are concerns that laparoscopic surgery increases the risk of contamination more than open surgery, therefore balancing the safety of HCP with the benefit of laparoscopic surgery for the patient. OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of potential contamination routes, possible risks for HCP, and propose research questions based on current literature and expert opinions about laparoscopic surgery on a COVID19 positive patient. METHODS: We performed a scoping review adding five additional questions concerning possible contaminating routes. A systematic search was performed on Pubmed, CINAHL, and Embase databases adding results from gray literature as well. The search was not only for COVID-19 but extended with virus contamination in general. We excluded society and professional association statements about COVID-19 if they did not add new insights into the available literature. RESULTS: The initial search provide 2.007 records, after which 267 full-text papers were considered. Finally, we used 84 papers of which 14 were discussing SARS-CoV-2. Eight papers discuss the added value of performing intubation in a low-pressure operating room, mainly based on the SARS outbreak experience from 2003. Thirteen papers elaborate on the risks of intubation for the HCP and SARS-CoV-2 and 19 papers discuss this situation with other viruses. They conclude that there is significant evidence that in- and extubation is a high-risk aerosol producing procedure. No papers were found on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 and surgical smoke, although 25 papers did provide conflicting evidence on the infection risk of HPV, hepatitis B, polio, and rabies. There were no papers found discussing tissue extraction or the deflation risk of the pneumoperitoneum after laparoscopic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: There seems to be consensus in the literature that in- and extubation is a high-risk procedure for the HCP and that maximum protective equipment is needed. On the other hand, minimal evidence is available discussing the actual risk of contamination of the HCP during laparoscopy itself.
