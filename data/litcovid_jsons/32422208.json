Objective: To determine the association between in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB and all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients with hypertension. Methods and Results: This retrospective, multi-center study included 1128 adult patients with hypertension diagnosed with COVID-19, including 188 taking ACEI/ARB (ACEI/ARB group; median age 64 [IQR 55-68] years; 53.2% men) and 940 without using ACEI/ARB (non-ACEI/ARB group; median age 64 [IQR 57-69]; 53.5% men), who were admitted to nine hospitals in Hubei Province, China from December 31, 2019 to February 20, 2020. Unadjusted mortality rate was lower in the ACEI/ARB group versus the non-ACEI/ARB group (3.7% vs. 9.8%; P = 0.01). In mixed-effect Cox model treating site as a random effect, after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, and in-hospital medications, the detected risk for all-cause mortality was lower in the ACEI/ARB group versus the non-ACEI/ARB group (adjusted HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19-0.92; P =0.03). In a propensity score-matched analysis followed by adjusting imbalanced variables in mixed-effect Cox model, the results consistently demonstrated lower risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients who received ACEI/ARB versus those who did not receive ACEI/ARB (adjusted HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15-0.89; P = 0.03). Further subgroup propensity score-matched analysis indicated that, compared to use of other antihypertensive drugs, ACEI/ARB was also associated with decreased mortality (adjusted HR, 0.30; 95%CI, 0.12-0.70; P = 0.01) in COVID-19 patients with hypertension. Conclusions: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension, inpatient use of ACEI/ARB was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with ACEI/ARB non-users. While study interpretation needs to consider the potential for residual confounders, it is unlikely that in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB was associated with an increased mortality risk.","Circ Res","Zhang, Peng","Zhu, LiHua","Cai, Jingjing","Lei, Fang","Qin, Juan-Juan","Xie, Jing","Liu, Ye-Mao","Zhao, Yan-Ci","Huang, Xuewei","Lin, Lijin","Xia, Meng","Chen, Ming-Ming","Cheng, Xu","Zhang, Xiao","Guo, Deliang","Peng, Yuanyuan","Ji, Yan-Xiao","Chen, Jing","She, Zhi-Gang","Wang, Yibin","Xu, Qingbo","Tan, Renfu","Wang, Haitao","Lin, Jun","Luo, Pengcheng","Fu, Shouzhi","Cai, Hongbin","Ye, Ping","Xiao, Bing","Mao, Weiming","Liu, Liming","Yan, Youqin","Liu, Mingyu","Chen, Manhua","Zhang, Xiao-Jing","Wang, Xinghuan","Touyz, Rhian M","Xia, Jiahong","Zhang, Bing-Hong","Huang, Xiaodong","Yuan, Yufeng","Rohit, Loomba","Liu, Peter P","Li, Hongliang","32302265"],"abstract":["Rationale: Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) is a major concern for clinicians treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with hypertension.
