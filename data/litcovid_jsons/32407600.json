Most non-survivors tended to be males, old aged, or with chronic diseases. Compared to survivors, non-survivors showed significantly elevated white blood cell and neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII, defined by platelet count multiply by NLR), CRP, procalcitonin, and D-dimer, and decreased red blood cell, lymphocyte, and platelet count. Age, neutrophil count, platelet count, and CRP were identified as independent predictors of adverse outcome.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether elevated D-dimer levels could predict mortality in patients with Covid-19. METHODS: Patients with laboratory confirmed Covid-19 were retrospective enrolled in Wuhan Asia General Hospital from January 12, 2020 to March 15, 2020. D-dimer levels on admission, and death events were collected to calculate the optimum cutoff using receiver operating characteristic curve. According to the cutoff, the subjects were divided into two groups. Then the in-hospital mortality between two groups were compared to assess the predictive value of D-dimer level. RESULTS: A total of 343 eligible patients were enrolled in the study. The optimum cutoff value of D-dimer to predict in-hospital mortality was 2.0 microg/ml with a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 83.3%. There were 67 patients with D-dimer>/=2.0 microg/ml, and 267 patients with D-dimer <2.0 microg/ml on admission. 13 deaths occurred during hospitalization.
