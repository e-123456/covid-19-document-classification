Social media, especially, Sina Weibo (a major Chinese microblogging social media platform), has become an important platform for the public to obtain information and express their demand. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the characteristics of the suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients who asked for help on the Sina Weibo. METHODS: We conducted data mining on the Chinese social media site Sina Weibo and extracted the data of 485 patients that presented with at least clinical symptoms and imaging descriptions of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia from 9,878 posts seeking help on Weibo from February 3rd to 20th, 2020.We used descriptive research method to describe the distribution and other epidemiological characteristics of the patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The distance from their home to the nearest hospital was calculated using geographic information systems (ArcGIS). RESULTS: All patients seeking help on Weibo in this study lived in Wuhan, with a median age of 63.0 years (IQR, 55.0-71.0). Fever (84.12%, 408/485) was the most common symptom. Ground-glass opacity (75.48%, 237/314) was the most common pattern on chest computed tomography.39.67% (167/421) of families had laboratory-confirmed and/or suspected COVID-19 family members. 36.58% (154/421) of families had 1 or 2 laboratory-confirmed and/or suspected family members.70.52% (232/329) of patients needed to rely on their descendants for help. The median time from illness onset to real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) testing was 8 days (IQR, 5.0-10.0), and the median time from illness onset to online help was 10 days (IQR, 6.0-12.0). 32.22% (155/481) of patients lived more than 3 kilometers away from the nearest hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The patients seeking help on Weibo lived in Wuhan and most of the patients were elderly. Most of patients had fever symptoms and chest computed tomography mainly manifested as ground-glass opacity pattern.

Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. Exposures: Documented NCIP. Main Outcomes and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. Results: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]).

Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation).

Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0). Conclusions and Relevance: In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%."],"journal":"JAMA","authors":["Wang, Dawei","Hu, Bo","Hu, Chang","Zhu, Fangfang","Liu, Xing","Zhang, Jing","Wang, Binbin","Xiang, Hui","Cheng, Zhenshun","Xiong, Yong","Zhao, Yan","Li, Yirong","Wang, Xinghuan","Peng, Zhiyong"],"date":"2020-02-08T11:00:00Z","year":2020,"_id":"32031570","source":"PubMed","week":"20206|Feb 03 - Feb 09","doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1585","link_comment_in":"32266937","locations":["Wuhan","China","Wuhan","China","Wuhan","China","Wuhan","China"],"countries":["China"],"countries_codes":["CHN|China"],"e_drugs":["Moxifloxacin","Oseltamivir","Ceftriaxone","Azithromycin"],"topics":["Mechanism","Transmission"],"weight":1,"_version_":1666138490879868928,"score":183.56102}]}
