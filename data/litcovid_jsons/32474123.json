In order to anticipate the reinstatement of delayed interventions, surgical activity reduction analysis is essential. The objective of this study was to evaluate the reduction of urological surgery in adult during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019. MATERIAL: The data regarding urological procedures realized in the 8 academic urological departments of Parisians centres (AP-HP) were compared over two similar periods (14-29 March 2019 and 12-27 March 2020) using the centralized surgical planning software shared by these centres. Procedure title, type of surgery and outpatient ratio were collected. The interventions were sorted into 16 major families of urological interventions. RESULTS: Overall, a 55% decrease was observed concerning urological procedures over the same period between 2019 and 2020 (995 and 444 procedures respectively). Oncology activity and emergencies decreased by 31% and 44%. The number of kidney transplantations decreased from 39 to 3 (-92%). Functional, andrological and genital surgical procedures were the most impacted among the non-oncological procedures (-85%, -81% and -71%, respectively). Approximatively, 1033 hours of surgery have been delayed during this 16-day period. CONCLUSION: Lockdown and postponement of non-urgent scheduled urological procedures decisions has led to a drastic decrease in surgical activity in AP-HP.
