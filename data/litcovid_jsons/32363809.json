There is limited data on whether a specific symptom or collection of symptoms may be useful to predict test positivity. METHODS: An anonymous electronic survey was publicized through social media to query participants with COVID-19 testing. Respondents were questioned regarding 10 presenting symptoms, demographic information, comorbidities and COVID-19 test results. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify predictors for COVID positivity. Selected classifiers were assessed for prediction performance using receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC). RESULTS: One-hundred and forty-five participants with positive COVID-19 testing and 157 with negative results were included. Participants had a mean age of 39 years, and 214 (72%) were female. Smell or taste change, fever, and body ache were associated with COVID-19 positivity, and shortness of breath and sore throat were associated with a negative test result (p<0.05). A model using all 5 diagnostic symptoms had the highest accuracy with a predictive ability of 82% in discriminating between COVID-19 results. To maximize sensitivity and maintain fair diagnostic accuracy, a combination of 2 symptoms, change in sense of smell or taste and fever was found to have a sensitivity of 70% and overall discrimination accuracy of 75%. CONCLUSION: Smell or taste change is a strong predictor for a COVID-19 positive test result. Using the presence of smell or taste change with fever, this parsimonious classifier correctly predicts 75% of COVID-19 test results. A larger cohort of respondents will be necessary to refine classifier performance. This article is protected by copyright.

Physicians administered a survey-based questionnaire to SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with the aim of assessing symptoms, focusing on OD and GD. Two groups were studied: patients hospitalized at ASST Spedali Civili University Hospital of Brescia (A); home-quarantined subjects (B). RESULTS: A total of 508 patients were enrolled: 295 in Group A and 213 in Group B. Mean age (+/-SD) was 55+/-15 years; 56% were men. Overall, OD and GD were present in 56% (95% CI 51-60%) and 63% (59-67%) of cases, respectively. In Group A, the prevalence of OD and GD was 44% (38-50%) and 52% (46-58%).
