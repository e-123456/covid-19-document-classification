METHODS: We designed primers specific to the orf1ab and S genes of SARS-CoV-2. Total viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. We optimized the RT-LAMP assay. And, this assay was evaluated for its sensitivity and specificity of detection using real-time turbidity monitoring and visual observation. RESULTS: The primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123 amplified the genes in the shortest times, the mean (+/-SD) time was 18 +/- 1.32 min and 20 +/- 1.80 min, respectively, and 63 degrees C was the optimum reaction temperature. The sensitivity was 2x10(1) copies and 2x10(2) copies per reaction with primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123, respectively. This assay showed no cross-reactivity with other 60 respiratory pathogens.
