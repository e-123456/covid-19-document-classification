Neurologists must weigh up the need to start or continue disease-modifying treatments against the risk of infection, the risk of complications from the infection, and the risk of multiple sclerosis activity. Since this is an unprecedented situation, most decisions are being made on the basis of a theoretical approach and the criteria of each neurologist. AIMS: The aim of this study is conduct a literature search to collect available evidence on the relationship between disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection. This evidence, together with the experience of the authors in the management of patients with multiple sclerosis during the pandemic, will make it possible to offer some proposals for the treatment and follow-up of patients in this epidemiological context. DEVELOPMENT: After the literature search and our experience in the management of patients, a number of proposals for treatment are established for each drug, which must necessarily be individualised for each patient, since, in these exceptional circumstances, their peculiarities can affect the prognosis.

It has been speculated that patients with comorbidities and elderly patients could be at high risk for respiratory insufficiency and death. Immunosuppression could expose infected patients to even higher risks of disease complications due to dampened immune response. However, it has been speculated that overactive immune response could drive clinical deterioration and, based on this hypothesis, several immunosuppressants are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19. METHODS: In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with ocrelizumab (a B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody) for primary progressive multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19. RESULTS: Despite complete B cell depletion, patient symptoms abated few days after hospitalization, and he was discharged to home-quarantine. Phone interview follow-up confirmed that, after 14 days, no new symptoms occurred. DISCUSSION: This report supports the putative role of immunosuppressive therapy in COVID-19 affected patients.","Mult Scler Relat Disord","Novi, Giovanni","Mikulska, Malgorzata","Briano, Federica","Toscanini, Federica","Tazza, Francesco","Uccelli, Antonio","Inglese, Matilde","32315980"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a novel disease entity that is spreading throughout the world.
