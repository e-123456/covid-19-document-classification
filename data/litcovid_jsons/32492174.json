Little is known about the development of acute pancreatitis as a complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. This case report describes the presentation of acute pancreatitis in two of three family members with severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Data were collected from three family members admitted with COVID-19 to the intensive care unit in March 2020. This study was reviewed and approved by the local data and ethics committee (31-1521-253). RESULTS: Two of the three family members were diagnosed with acute pancreatitis associated with SARS-CoV-2. Other causes of acute pancreatitis were excluded for both patients (including alcohol, biliary obstruction/gall stones, drugs, trauma, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia, and hypotension). CONCLUSIONS: These cases highlight acute pancreatitis as a complication associated with COVID-19 and underlines the importance of measuring pancreas-specific plasma amylase in patients with COVID-19 and abdominal pain.","Pancreatology","Hadi, Amer","Werge, Mikkel","Kristiansen, Klaus Tjelle","Pedersen, Ulf Gottrup","Karstensen, John Gasdal","Novovic, Srdan","Gluud, Lise Lotte","32387082"],"abstract":["BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Abdominal pain is one of the known symptoms associated with coronavirus disease 2019.
